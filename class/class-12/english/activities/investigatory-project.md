# Investigatory Project

{% hint style="success" %}
**Assessment**: Final exam's internals.
{% endhint %}

## Objectives

* For the student to research, understand, debate and substantiate their ideas about a lesson-related theme.
* To inculcate a journalistic or holistic reporter approach to a particular subject.
* To improve a student's core English communicative and practical skills

## Action Plan (Model)

The Action Plan gives us a list of due dates…. (they are not submission dates). It means you can submit on or before the given dates.

1. **Selection of Topic and Medium:** March - 27/03/2024
2. **Preparation of Questionnaires / Interview Questions / Scripts etc. :** April - 17/03/2024
3. **Essay of a 1000 words:** June - 27/06/2024
4. **Report of the Research:** July - 25/07/2024
5. **Final Submission:** August - 22/08/2024

## Timeline

1. **Topic and Medium Submission:** Submit the topic of your research project to the teacher on the allotted date. The topic should adhere to a theme or a sub-theme related to any lesson or poem in the English coursework for Class 12. It is generally recommended that you do not attempt to take up a vague topic as a part of your project, since it is imperative that you do justice to your topic. Eg: Cloud Nine, Hero Worship, Gender discrimination in Work environment (like women and men in the same field and strata), Population of India, Marginalization, Poverty Line, Uniform Civil Code, Corruption Charges, Treason Charges, Property Ownership Issues, Property Destruction Issues, Accidents, Starbucks, T\&C Issues - McAfee Virus Protection Pledge, Adobe Suite of Products being pirated by people, Netflix Password Sharing Issues etc The medium should be a sub-project (preferably a one-act play, drama, skit, podcast or videocast with the transcript) that you'll do to substantiate your views.
2. **Research:** This part will span throughout the entire duration of the activity, gathering ideas, presenting newspaper clippings, views etc. Document your research separately so that you won't miss it out while prepping for your viva.
3. **Interview/Questionnaire:** You are supposed to hold an interview or hand out a questionnaire to at least 5 people to gather their opinions on topics. The max no of responses allowed is 10. Before you perform this, you have to hand over a draft list of questions to the teacher on or before the given dates to get her approval to proceed with your work. If possible, you can take a pre-recorded interview of a prominent person's view of the topic along with the transcript. This exercise will also test your skills and command over the English language.

* Ms. Carmel Jeru Joachim (or Carmel Mani)

Do not be direct with questions that ask a person about their personal details or violate their privacy. Try to be as gentle as possible. E.g. Financial - How much do you earn per month? (Instead of asking them to fill in the exact salary, give them a scale on which they can select their income range.) E.g. Instead of asking a woman "Are you harassed in your workplace?", ask "On a scale of 1 to 10, how safe do you feel in your workplace?"

The interview can be held in any language, but it must be transcribed to English before attaching it as a part of the report. Record your interviews for evidence, if possible.

Your aim will be to substantiate your claims in the essay with this exercise; along with research evidence.

E.g. of an online questionnaire:-

[A Survey on the Indian Education System](https://ex9eroobyrl.typeform.com/to/UoRgwb18?utm\_campaign=preview#key=preview)

1. **Essay:** Based on your research, inferences from the interview/questionnaire and the sub-project, you are supposed to write an essay for 1000 words (i.e 10 sides/pages). The original draft of essay can be typed out and a printout can be given over to the teacher for review and corrections. However, the final essay should be handwritten on a single side of every sheet of paper that you'll use. It should be submitted to the teacher when necessitated. It should be written in blue ink completely. You can decorate the borders. It is the culmination of your research, you views and inferences of the questionnaire.
2. **Report** - It should be a culmination, a summary, an end to the entire project. It can be titled as "conclusions", "reflections", "report", or "Inferences". It can be printed out and use pie charts or bar graphs from the results of the survey. It should be analytical paragraph that includes your opinions too. You’re supposed to take relevant data (effectively filtering out the personally identifiable data such as name etc and some basic data), type or write it out in one full side/page (both the minimum and maximum no of pages you’re allowed to use - i.e your report should cover one full side completely). Add pie charts and bar graphs from your survey results in the report. The idea of this "report" is to effectively answer the question whether the collected data and final inferences prove your original stand about the topic.
3. **Essay, Interview/Questionnaire Results & Report submission** - Ma’am will make the necessary corrections and give it back to you in 3-4 days’ time.
4. **Portfolio** - After your content has been approved by the teacher, softly bound your findings into a neat portfolio, with a black soft-bound. It should/can contain (not necessarily in this you order)

[PROJECT PRINTOUTS.doc](https://res.craft.do/user/full/b8b89018-aef2-86a2-127d-5e07bf8933bc/doc/4C711A56-DD85-4491-86B4-D7CBF5B4EC5B/583876a8-d648-4b91-45c6-9b80bee939b1)

* **Title/Cover Page:** Can be printed or hand-written. Should contain a picture related to your findings.
* **Research:** Attach physical evidence of your research, like newspaper clippings, ads etc…
* **Essay:** Attach the version of the essay that contains the teacher's sign.
* **Questionnaire Results or Interview Transcripts:**
  * Include the original sample questionnaire or interview questions at first.
  * If your interview is a physical or digital interview, try your best to record the interview and write the exact transcript on paper or in a digital format. It is not necessary to include a full transcript, so redact personal information as and when required. You can include custom questions, but only if the teacher has approved them previously.
  * If your questionnaire is a physical handout, then attach the physical handouts as part of the portfolio.
  * If your questionnaire is digital, attach the responses separately or attach a combined report.
