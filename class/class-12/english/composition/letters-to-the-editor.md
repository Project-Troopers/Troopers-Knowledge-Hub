Subject: Darkness around Sunrise Apartments

Sir  
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the kind attention of the relevant authorities towards the pathetic condition of residents of Sunrise Apartments, Gymkhana Road.

The conditions of the road at Gymkhana Road is really pathetic.  There are three open manholes on the main road leading to our colony. These open manholes are turning into death traps for the residents who have demanded that the authorities concerned take steps to cover them. Moreover, our colony has no street lights, since the Just two months. There are no street lights even on the main road leading to our colony. With the open manholes and lack of street lights, accidents are on a rise. The road gets dark after seven in the evening. People fear going out, not only to avoid accidents but also to avoid being prey to unscrupulous elements. The open manholes not only emit bad smell and cause pollution but are also a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Motorists, elders, and children are the main victims of these manholes, and many times, accidents have been reported due to these open manholes. Whenever torrential rains hit the areas, they cause even more problems.  Hence it is important that the concerned authorities take action to alleviate the situation.  This will surely help the residents of Gymkhana Road.

I hope this letter will elicit a suitable response from our elected representatives.

Yours Truly  
Amita
