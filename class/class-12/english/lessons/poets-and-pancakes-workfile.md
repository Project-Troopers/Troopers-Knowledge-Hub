**THEME**

"Poets and Pancakes" takes us behind the scenes of Gemini Studios, a famous film studio in Chennai. The chapter shows the daily life and activities at the studio, focusing on the various roles people played in making movies.

It shows that what people see on screen is just for the sake of the camera and the actors acting or people involved in the film are different in reality with different lives of their own.

**Read the following extracts and answer with reference to the context:**

1. “The rat fights the tigress underwater and kills her but takes pity on the cubs and tends them lovingly – I don’t know how to do the scene,” the producer would say and Subbu would come out with four ways of the rat pouring affection on its victim’s offspring. “Good, but I am not sure it is effective enough,” the producer would say and in a minute Subbu would come out with fourteen more alternatives. Film-making must have been and was so easy with a man like Subbu around and if ever there was a man who gave direction and definition to Gemini Studios during its golden years, it was Subbu.
