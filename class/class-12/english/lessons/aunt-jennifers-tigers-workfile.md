**ABOUT THE POET**

**Adrienne Cecile Rich** (May 16, 1929 – March 27, 2012) was an American poet, essayist and [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism). She was called "one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century", and was credited with bringing "the oppression of women to the forefront of poetic discourse". Rich criticized the rigid forms of feminist identities.

Her first collection of poetry, _A Change of World_, was selected by renowned poet [W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden) for the [Yale Series of Younger Poets Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Series_of_Younger_Poets_Award). Auden went on to write the introduction to the published volume. She famously declined the [National Medal of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Arts), protesting the vote by [House Speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives) [Newt Gingrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich) to end funding for the [National Endowment for the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts)

**THEME**

**Central Theme:** The central theme of Adrienne Rich's "Aunt Jennifer's Tigers" is how patriarchal dominance dominates but not the minds of women. The poem highlights this by introducing and comparing the wild, exotic, strong tigers browned by Aunt Jennifer to Aunt Jennifer’s.

Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers prance and jump across a screen. They are bright coloured like the shining yellow topaz. These denizens’ or the dwellers of the green forests are brought in the panel by Aunt Jennifer. She creates them through her own hands. They don’t fear the men standing under the tree. They pace in ‘sleek’ and ‘chivalric’ certainty.

Aunt Jennifer’s hands are moving about her wool. But the movement is not smooth and effortless. Aunt finds it quite hard to pull even the ivory needle. The heavy weight of the marriage band that bonded her with her husband sits heavily upon her hand. She still feels tied down by that weight.

Her terrified hands will tell the whole story of her unhappy life even when aunt is dead. Hardships and sufferings were the parts of her married life. These crushed her. She was in the grip of very tough life. But the tigers she has made in the panel will go on jumping ahead, proud and unafraid.
