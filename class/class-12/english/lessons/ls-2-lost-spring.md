# Lost Spring

{% hint style="info" %}
**Theme! üé§**

Lost Spring, based on socio-economic problems (poverty is considered a legacy), is a sad commentary on how poverty and tradition condemn children to exploitation and misery. The lesson reveals grinding poverty in India and exposes the underbelly of India's economic miserable and pitiable progress. The author depicts conditions which our children live in. The title signifies how childhood, often compared to and marked by fun, frolic and movement, is Spring snapped away from the children. The children in Seemapuri and Firozabad are exploited badly and are deprived of their childhood i.e. the spring is of their life.

## Overview
### What do you think of when someone utters the word "spring"?
We think of the spring season, a indicator of new life, new beginnings, new hope, and the end of winter. It signifies the time when the plants blossom and saplings sprout out from the ground. 
Saplings are young, vulnerable, vibrant, full of vitality (potential) and brittle (or fragile). With the proper nourishment and the right conditions, the sapling can grow into a strong plant or huge tree.
Saplings, as a metaphor, can be used to relate to childhood. Childhood is the time when kids are fearless, proactive and inquisitive. They dream and think of all that they can be, even if it isn't possible. Being a tooth fairy, for example, is one such dream of a child.
But we, the elders, crush the sapling. We crush the child's dream by imbibing fear and subservience in them. We say and reason that not all things are possible; some ideas (like becoming a tooth fairy) are too absurd.
That's at least fair in some respects. If you're able to read this information online, then you are better off than a whole lot of other children, ones who have faced war, famine, homelessness, assault, toiling away to earn some money to eat; and most importantly, ones who have faced death and murder, the ones who are left orphans.
However, we, the blessed children, fail to look at the half-full part of the tumbler.
Well, some of us, the better-off ones, donate what we can to help these people. However, some of these donations do not reach the ones that we intended. Instead, some of them are dry-cleaned and resold in the second-hand market for a profit of the entire MRP that is stuck onto these clothes. Charity is being used to making profits. This is, one of the worst forms of stealing.
Developed countries are very very good when it comes to child development programs. They have good support system, like social workers and foster homes to take care of kids facing trouble. Most importantly, there is no distinction between the education received by children in public schools and private schools.

**But in India?**
The average fees for a "good school" in Chennai is around 1 lakh per year. Most parents still can't afford to pay these fees, as that might be their annual income itself.
For those who think that public schools have quality education, yes, it is true, and situation is still improving.
Looking past the above things, why are there still dropouts? **Greed.**
In today's world, **GREED** forces others into poverty. We kill childhood due to greed. Most of today's problems could be easily solved if we can factor out "Greed" and "Gain".

### ANSWER IN BRIEF IN ABOUT 40-50 WORDS:

1. **How can suspension of activities help?**
2. **What, according to Pablo Neruda, would be the ultimate end of man if the present scenario of wars continued?**
   **VER 1:** Pablo Neruda believed that man would end up digging his own grave if the present state of affairs continued. He believed so due to the rising concerns of handling of ammunition across the world, and mounting tensions which could lead to the next world war. His beliefs were also based on the fact that people were becoming ignoramus of others needs and were subjugating others by not allowing them to come up in life.
   **VER 2:** Pablo Neruda believed that if the present scenario of wars continued, humanity would end up digging its own grave. He expressed concerns about the reckless handling of ammunition and mounting global tensions, which could lead to another world war. Additionally, he pointed out that people were becoming increasingly ignorant of others' needs and were subjugating others, preventing them from progressing in life.
3. **How does the poet bring out the images of disharmony between man and nature in ‚ÄòKeeping Quiet‚Äô and how can it be resolved?**
	The poet's use of imagery to drill down on the negative impact of wars is phenomenal in nature. He ensures it by describing the different kind of wars that we humans wage by wielding different elements of Mother Earth that provides us with life. He metaphorically connects the fisherman and the whales as the oppressors and the oppressed, and also literally asks us to preserve Mother Nature as it is. He vividly illustrates his point to see the effect that manual labourers and basic natural things had on society by alluding them to the salt labourers and asking them to look at themselves for once, to realise their importance to the society which has disregarded and subjugated them. It also promotes the idea of universal brotherhood by drawing parallels with the people who would walk among others normally, whereas if the world was not silent, they would have been part of the war effort. Man, who wishes to destroy others for the sake of personal gain, is at odds with nature which wishes to provide life to all and recovers easily from the attacks that man may propagate on it.
