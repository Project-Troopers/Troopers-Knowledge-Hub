# Poem 5 - A ROADSIDE STAND



{% hint style="info" %}
#### **THEME**

In ‘A Roadside Stand’, the poet Robert Frost describes the miserable condition of the people living in the countryside. The city people who drive through the countryside hardly stop at the roadside stand nor do they care tor the people who run it. If at all they do stop, they do so to criticise the place and the people. Frost describes the lives of the poor people with pitiless clarity and with deepest sympathy and humanity.&#x20;

The poem implies that even seemingly insignificant things, like a tiny fruit shop, can have profound beauty and significance. It also considers the innocence and ignorance of these poor people and how they expect from the rich. The poem also discusses the idea of how the government agencies befool them.
