# Overview

This year, the practicals have wide-ranging portions that you'd have to consider for the exams.

## Portions

### Salt Analysis

1. We will have 10 salts in general for the exam.
2. There may be a change in the combinations of cations and anions.
3. Common cations are: $$Ba^{2+}$$, $$Sr^{2+}$$, $$Ca^{2+}$$, $$Zn^{2+}$$, $$Al^{3+}$$, $$NH_4^+$$, $$Pb^{2+}$$
4. Common anions are: $$CO_3^{2-}$$, $$SO_4^{2-}$$, $$PO_4^{2-}$$, $$C_2O_4^{2-}$$, $$CH_3COO^-$$, $$Cl^-$$, $$NO_3^-$$
5. You must learn at least 2 confirmatory tests for each radical.

### Volumetric Analysis

(finding the molarityâ€¦ learning the formula)

1. Oxalic Acid Vs $$KMnO_4$$
2. F.A.S Vs $$KMnO_4$$
