### What is a flower, anyway?

* To the average person, flowers are of aesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value. They convey human emotions.
* To a biologist, however, flowers are **::morphological and embryological marvels::** and the sites of sexual reproduction. ::📝 **Frequently Asked Questions**::

## Pre-fertilisation: Structures and events

#### Before the actual flower is formed…

> _Hormonal and structural changes → Differentiation and further development of the floral primordium → Inflorescences (bear the floral buds and then the flowers) → The androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop._

**AI-generated imagery. Not accurate. Prompt**: (Refer to the block in focus)

### The Androecium

The androecium is a whorl of the flower, which is made up of Stamens. Now, stamens are the male reproductive units of the flowers. Each stamen is made up of two parts - the anther and the filament. The number and length of the stamens vary with each flower species.

**📸 Perspective Corner**

**What does proximal refer to?**

Proximal refers to the closer end of something. In this reference; we call the point where the filament attaches to the thalamus, _'proximal'_ because it is the part that is closer to the main parts of the plant, like the stem, etc.

Now, if something is called terminal, then it would refer to an "end" of the filament. The word "terminal" can differ with place of usage. Here, we will use the word "terminal" to refer to the further end of the filament.

1.  **Filament**

    The filament is a long and slender stalk that has a terminal structure called Anther attached to it. The proximal end of the filament is attached to the thalamus or the petal of the flower.
2.  **Anther**

    An anther is a bilobed structure _(usually)_ that is terminally attached to the filament. This "bilobed" nature of the anther is usually visible in the transverse section of the anther. Each lobe had two theca, thus they are referred to as <mark style="background-color:blue;">**dithecous**</mark>. A longitudinal groove runs lengthwise separating the theca.

#### Microsporangia

The structure of the anther, that we saw before, in effect, makes it a four-sided (tetragonal) structure consisting of four **microsporangia** located at the corners, two in each lobe.

The microsporangia develop further and become pollen sacs. The pollen sacs run the entire length of the anther and are packed with pollen grains.

37. Explain the floral reward provided by the yucca plant. 38. How does self-incompatibility restrict autogamy?
38. Give an account of the significance of double fertilization.
39. Write the names of different layers of the anther. Mention the role of any one of these.
40. If the ploidy on the egg is "n, what will be the ploidy of the endosperm of the same plant? Why endosperm is supposed to have nutritive tissue?
