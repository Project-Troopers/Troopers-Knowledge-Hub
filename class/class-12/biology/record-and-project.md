### Project

#### Biology Investigatory Project for Class 12 CBSE

The Biology Investigatory Project is an essential part of the Class 12 CBSE curriculum, designed to enhance students' understanding and application of biological theories and concepts through practical, real-world exploration. This project encourages students to engage in hands-on experiments, research, and analysis in the field of biology, thereby fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and scientific inquiry.

**Objective**

The main objective of the investigatory project is to allow students to apply theoretical concepts in practical situations, encouraging them to explore and investigate biology topics beyond the textbook, and develop a scientific temper and research skills.

**Selection of Topic**

Students are advised to select a topic that:

* Sparks their interest and curiosity.
* Is feasible in terms of resources and time.
* Has a scope for exploration and investigation.
* Can be demonstrated live in the lab in front of the examiner.

**Procedure**

1. **Topic Selection:** Choose a topic that aligns with the CBSE syllabus and has enough scope for investigation. Get that topic approved by the teacher before proceeding with it.
2. **Research:** Conduct a thorough review of existing literature to gather background information.
3. **Experimentation:** Conduct the experiment(s) as per the approved proposal, making sure to follow safety and ethical guidelines.
4. **Observation and Data Collection:** Record observations meticulously and collect data systematically.
5. **Analysis:** Analyze the data to draw conclusions.
6. **Report Writing:** Compile the findings, analyses, and conclusions into a detailed project report.

**Report Structure (Rough Draft, please wait for the teacher to provide the proper structure)**

* Title Page
* Table of Contents
* Acknowledgement
* Introduction
* Review of Literature
* Objectives
* Hypothesis
