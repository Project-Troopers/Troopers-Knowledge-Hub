4. 3 resistors having resistances r1, r2 and r3 are connected as shown in the given circuit. the ratio i3/il of currents in terms of resistances used in the circuit is
5. The charge flowing through a resistance R varies with time t as Q=at-bt^2 where a and b are positive constants. The total heat produced in R is
6. A potentiometer circuit has been set up for finding the internal resistance of a given cell. The main battery, used across the potentiometer wire, has an emf of 2.0 V and a negligible internal resistance. The potentiometer wire itself is 4m long. When the resistance R is connected across the given cell, has values of (i) infinity, (ii)9.5 ohm, the 'balancing lengths' on the potentiometer wire are found to be 3m and 2.85 m respectively. The value of internal resistance is?
