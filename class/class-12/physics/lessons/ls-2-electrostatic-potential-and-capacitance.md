## Questions

1. A regular hexagon of side 10cm has a charge 5uC at each of its vertices . Calculate the potential at the centre of the hexagon.
2. As in the figure, if a capacitor of capacitance 'C' is charged by connecting it with resistance 'R', then energy given by the battery will be a) 1/2CV^2 b) less than 1/2CV^2 c) CV^2 d) more than CV^2

1. Electric potential: $$V = \frac{W}{q}$$
2. W = $$q (V_A-V_B) \ where \ V_A > V_B$$
3. E = $$- \frac{dV}{dl}$$ (relation between electric intensity and potential)
4. Electric potential at point due to isolated point charge, $$V = \frac{1}{4πε_o} \frac{q}{r}$$
5. Electric potential at point due to an electric dipole, $$V = \frac{1}{4πε_o} \frac{p \ cos \theta}{r^2}$$
6. Potential energy of system of charges in the absence of external electric field - is due to superposition principle which is very similar to addition of vectors
7. Potential energy of system of charges in the presence of external electric field
   1. Single charge: - U = Vq
   2. Two charges: -$$U= V(r_1)q_1+ V(r_2)q_2+ \frac{1}{4πε_o} \frac{q_1q_2}{r_{12}}$$
   3. Electric dipole: $$U =- pE (cos θ_o-cos θ_1)$$
8. $$C= \frac{Q}{V}$$
9. Capacitance of parallel plate capacitor: $$V = \frac{ε_rε_oA}{d}$$
10. Energy stored in capacitor, $$E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
11. <mark style="background-color:orange;">Series combination of capacitors, -= +1+- C1C2</mark>
    1. <mark style="background-color:orange;">For two capacitors connected in series, Cs = +C2</mark>
    2. <mark style="background-color:orange;">For n identical capacitors connected in series, Cn =-</mark>
12. Parallel combination of capacitors, $$C_p$$ = C1 + C2+ C3
    1. For two Capacitors connected in parallel, $$C_p$$ = C1+ C2
    2. For n identical capacitors connected in parallel, $$C_p$$ = nC
13. Dielectric polarization P = x E where x is electric susceptibility
