1. **Hydra**

## Classification

| **Kingdom** | Animalia   |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **Phylum**  | Cnidaria   |
| **Class**   | Hydrozoa   |
| **Order**   | Hydroida   |
| **Genus**   | Hydra      |
| **Species** | _Vulgaris_ |

## Comments

* it is an aquatic fresh water plant, which attaches on to a substrate of choice (e.g. rocks, sea floor) using its basal end. Sometimes it can get detached from the water and move about; floating, somersaulting, etc.
* It is hermaphrodite, and found in the polyp form.
* It has 6-10 tentacles that have cnidocytes (stinging cells), these tentacles are attached to the hypostome (a dialated region around the mouth) and help in locomotion and capturing prey.
* It is diploblastic in nature, with mesoglea in between the epidermis and gastrodermis
* It can asexually reproduce by budding and sexually by gametes produced by the ovaries and testes on the body.

2. **Spirogyra (Water Silk or Pond Scum)**

## Classification

| **Kingdom**  | Plantae       |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| **Division** | Chlorophyta   |
| **Class**    | Chlorophycea  |
| **Genus**    | Spirogyra sp. |

## Comments

* It is a multicellular green algae living in fresh water, with cylindrical cells vertically attached to each other in each filament.
* The organism reproduces sexually by conjugation and asexually by fragmentation.
* The cytoplasm is present towards the periphery of each cell; while the nucleus is present in the central vacuole, held by cytoplasmic strands.
* They have a mucilagenous sheath.
* The chloroplast is spiral or ribbon shaped, bearing pyrenoids..
* The cell wall is two-layered and made up of cellulose and pectin.

3. **Yeast**

## Classification

| **Kingdom** | Fungi         |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| **Phylum**  | Eumycocetes   |
| **Class**   | Ascomycetes   |
| **Genus**   | Saccharomyces |

## Comments

* It is the only unicellular fungi classified under the Kingdom Fungi, can be oval or elliptical.
* It reproduces asexually by budding and sexually by ascospores.
* It can form pseudo-mycelium by repeated budding, it’s walls are made of chitin.
* It grows in a sugary medium and is used in wine formation, baking etc.
* The volutin granules and glycogen droplets act as reserve food in the cytoplasm.
* It has a large central vacuole and nucleus is located to one of the sides with dark strands.

## How the exam will be conducted?

The practical exam question paper will be made up of 3 parts:-

1.  **Part A**

    It will consists of two major experiments (compulsory). You will be asked to perform these two experiments and write down the stipulated sections as indicated. You might be asked to write Aim, Materials Required, Procedure, Results (Observation and Conclusions), Diagram, Floral Formula (if required) and/or Precautions.

    There will be one or two experimental set-ups, where you might have to identify the parts or write the Aim, Materials Required, Procedure, Results (Observation and Conclusions), Diagram and/or Precautions.
2.  **Part B**

    It will consist of specimens and spotters, where you will be asked 8 specimens/spotters. You must write at least two comments for each. (If one comment is wrong, mam will take up the other comment and give you marks. But you must write at least two comments otherwise mam might strike out the whole answer.)

    For at least one specimen, you will be asked to draw the diagram. For at least two or three specimens, you will be asked to write the classification.
3.  **Part C**

    This is the place where your records and Viva will be evaluated. It'll be for a combined total of 9 or 10 marks, subject to change. You will be asked general viva on all the experiments that are part of this annual exam's portions. Please read the related **Theory** and **Viva Voce** section in the biology manual (it is a must). If possible, read the related lessons, including the full Morphology of Flowering Plants \[this is a suggestion, based on the questions asked during the Viva of the Second Brigadier Regiment (the Second Biology Corps)].

## Miscellaneous Viva nice-to-know stuff

* KOH is the chemical that takes in $$CO_2$$from the environment.
* Chlorophyll-a and Chlorophyll-b look green when their chromatographic gradient is taken on a paper, while Xanthophylls and Carotenoids look red and orange in color.
* The male ascaris has a spiral end while the female counterpart does not.
* It’s best to learn both the common name and biological name of an organism.
* Glycolysis is a 10-step process.
* Fats are usually provided as liquid or solid capsules.
* The action by which the water rises on the paper is called the **capillary action**.
* Acetone or nail polish remover is the liquid used in the paper chromatography experiment.
* Safranin is the stain used to dye the sample obtained in the "stomata" experiment. Use glycerin to remove the excess stain, if needed.
