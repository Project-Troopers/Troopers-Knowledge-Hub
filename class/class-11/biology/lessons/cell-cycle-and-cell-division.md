## M Phase: What Happens in this Phase of the Cell Cycle?

The cell cycle consists of distinct phases, including interphase and the M phase. The M phase is also known as mitosis, where cells reproduce asexually to create new cells.

During interphase, the cell goes through G1, S, and G2 stages. In G1, all the cell's contents except for the chromosomes are duplicated. In the S phase, the chromosomes are replicated. In G2, the cell checks for errors and makes needed fixes before entering the M phase.

Some cells, like those in the liver, may enter a phase called G0, where they spend a long time without dividing after completing mitosis.

Mitosis is the process in eukaryotic cells that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from one parent cell. It is asexual and involves the splitting of chromosomes. Mitosis consists of prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each phase has its own specific events, such as chromosome condensation, spindle attachment, chromosome alignment, chromatid separation, and membrane reformation.

Telophase marks the end of mitosis, where the chromosomes de-condense, the nuclear membrane is reassembled, and the cell divides into two identical daughter cells.

Overall, the M phase of the cell cycle involves the replication and division of chromosomes to create new cells.

## Meiosis: Definition, Phases 1 & 2, Difference from Mitosis

### What Is Meiosis?

Meiosis is a complex cell division process that plays a crucial role in sexual reproduction in animals, humans, and plants. Unlike mitosis, which produces two identical daughter cells, meiosis results in the formation of four haploid daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

Meiosis is divided into two parts: meiosis I and meiosis II. Each part consists of several phases or stages of cell division. Meiosis I includes prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. Meiosis II consists of prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II.

### What Are the Phases in Meiosis I?

In meiosis I, the parent cell undergoes interphase before division. Interphase consists of three subphases: G1 phase, S phase, and G2 phase. During interphase, the parent cell prepares for division by increasing in size, synthesizing DNA, and synthesizing proteins. Following interphase, prophase I begins. In prophase I, the chromosomes condense and pair up to form tetrads through a process called synapsis. This allows for genetic recombination or "crossing over" of genes. The chromosomes then thicken, detach from the nuclear envelope, and migrate to the metaphase plate. In metaphase I, the tetrads align themselves at the metaphase plate, with the centromeres of the chromosome pairs facing opposite poles. Anaphase I is characterized by the movement of chromosomes to opposite sides of the cell, pulled by kinetochore fibers. Telophase I concludes meiosis I, as the spindle fibers continue to pull the chromosome pairs to opposite poles, resulting in the formation of two daughter haploid cells through cytokinesis.

### What Are the Phases of Meiosis II?

Meiosis II follows a similar pattern to meiosis I, but with some differences. In metaphase II, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase II plate, with the kinetochore fibers of sister chromatids pointing towards opposite poles. Anaphase II involves the separation of sister chromatids, which become individual chromosomes and migrate to opposite poles. Telophase II marks the end of meiosis II, as nuclei form at each opposite pole and cytokinesis occurs to form two additional daughter haploid cells.

### How Is Meiosis Different From Mitosis?

The key difference between meiosis and mitosis lies in the number of daughter cells, genetic composition, length of prophase, formation of tetrads, chromosome alignment in metaphase, and method of chromosome separation.

| It is the cell division of cytoplasm that occurs during the M phase of the cell cycle. | It is the separation of daughter chromosomes corresponding to the M phase of the cell cycle |

***

**3. Describe the events taking place during interphase.**

**Solution:**

**Events taking place during interphase are as follows:**

* G1 phase (Gap 1) – During this stage, the cell is metabolically active. It grows and prepares the DNA to replicate.
* S phase (Synthesis) – During this stage, the synthesis of DNA takes place. The DNA quantity doubles, whereas the number of chromosomes remains unchanged
* G2 phase (Gap 2) – During this phase, the cell advances to grow and prepares itself for division. It is during this stage that the RNA and proteins that are required for mitosis are generated.

***

**4. What is Go (quiescent phase) of cell cycle?**

**Solution:**

In adult animals, some cells will not exhibit cell division, and many other cells occasionally divide when there is a need to replace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These cells exit the G1 phase to enter an inactive stage of the cell cycle called the G0 phase. Cells in the G0 phase do not proliferate unless called on to do so. Hence, the cells in this phase tend to become inactive, stop dividing and become specialized through the differentiation process.

***

**5. Why is mitosis called equational division?**

**Solution:**

Mitosis is called equational division because the number of chromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same.

***

**6. Name the stage of cell cycle at which one of the following events occur:** **(i) Chromosomes are moved to spindle equator.** **(ii) Centromere splits and chromatids separate.** **(iii) Pairing between homologous chromosomes takes place.** **(iv) Crossing over between homologous chromosomes takes place.**

**Solution:**

i) Chromosomes are moved to the spindle equator in the Metaphase. ii) Centrosomes split, and chromatids separate in the Anaphase iii) Pairing between homologous chromosomes takes place in the Zygotene stage of prophase 1 in meiosis iv) Crossing over between homologous chromosomes takes place during the Pachytene stage of prophase 1 in meiosis

***

**7. Describe the following:** **(a) synapsis (b) bivalent (c) chiasmata** **Draw a diagram to illustrate your answer.**

**Solution:**

a) Synapsis – Homologous chromosomes pair together during Zygotene of prophase-I of meiosis. This pairing is called synapsis.

![Image.png](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/synapsis.png)

b) Bivalent or tetrad is the pair of complexes formed by a pair of synapsed homologous chromosomes during the zygotene of prophase I of meiosis.

![Image.png](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tetrad-complex.png)

c) Chiasmata

During diplotene, the paired chromosomes form an X-shaped structure known as chiasmata. At chiasmata, the crossing over between two non-sister chromatids takes place.

**12. What is the significance of meiosis?**

**Solution:**

Significances of Meiosis:

* It conserves the specific chromosome numbers of each species achieved across generations.
* Enhances the genetic variability in the population of organisms from generation to generation. These variations are significant for the evolution process.
* It produces gametes for sexual reproduction
* Promotes crossing over. It introduces a new combination of variations or traits
* Chromosomal mutations can occur due to abnormalities during meiosis. A few of these can be beneficial to organisms.

***

**13. Discuss with your teacher about** **(i) haploid insects and lower plants where cell division occurs.** **(ii) some haploid cells in higher plants where cell division does not occur.**

**Solution:**

i) Haploid insects where cell division occurs are drones of the honey bee, and lower plants are Spirogyra, Chlamydomonous, and Pteridophytes. These haploid gametes are produced by them through mitosis and not meiosis. ii) Spermatozoa and ova of higher animals and microspores of higher plants will not undergo cell division.

***

**14. Can there be mitosis without DNA replication in the ‘S’ phase?**

**Solution:**

During the S phase, DNA synthesis or replication of DNA takes place. DNA replication is essential for cell division. Without DNA replication, cell division will not take place.

***

**15. Can there be DNA replication without cell division?**

**Solution:**

Yes, DNA replication can take place without cell division. In order to prepare for cell division, DNA replication is necessary. Cell division is the succeeding logical step that occurs post cell division.

***

**16. Analyse the events during every stage of the cell cycle and notice how the following two parameters change** **(i) the number of chromosomes (N) per cell** **(ii) the amount of DNA content (C) per cell**

**Solution:**

i) Yes, DNA replication can take place in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The number of chromosomes remains the same, and each chromosome is formed from one chromatid. In the S phase, a chromosome is formed by two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. Similar conditions continue in the G2 phase, while in the M phase, sister chromatids separate and move to different cells. The number of chromosomes stays the same in mitosis.

ii) Amount of DNA content in the cell remains the same in the G1 phase, but in the S phase, it doubles as the DNA replication takes place. It remains double in the G2 phase but halved in the M phase of the cell cycle.

### Short Answers

**1. State the role of centrioles other than spindle formation.**

**Solution:**

Centriole forms the microtubule and forms the basal body of flagella.

**2. Mitochondria and plastids have their DNA (genetic material). What is known about their fate during nuclear division, like mitosis?**

**Solution:**

DNA present in mitochondria in plastids is called the extrachromosomal DNA.

They are independent of the nuclear division of nuclear DNA. Hence, no effect of mitosis is seen on extrachromosomal DNA.

**3. Label the diagram and also determine the stage at which this structure is visible.**

**Solution**:

![Image.png](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ncert-exemplar-solutions-of-class-11-biology-chapter-10-cell-cycle-and-cell-division-2.png)

**4. A cell has 32 chromosomes. It undergoes mitotic division. What will be the chromosome number (N) during metaphase? What would be the DNA content (C) during anaphase?**

**Solution**:

Both N and C will be 32. This is because DNA is replicated during the S phase, after that it would remain the same during equational division.

**5. While examining the mitotic stage in a tissue, one finds some cells with 16 chromosomes and some with 32 chromosomes. What possible reasons could you assign to this difference in chromosome number? Do you think cells with 16 chromosomes could have arisen from cells with 32 chromosomes or vice versa?**

**Solution:**

Mosaicism refers to the presence of two different types of chromosome numbers in different cells of the body. This can occur as a result of chromosome non-disjunction or a delay in the separation of chromosomes during cell division.

**a. Nuclear membrane fails to disintegrate**

**b. Duplication of DNA does not occur**

**c. Centromeres do not divide**

**d. Cytokinesis does not occur**

**Solution:**

a. Nuclear membrane fails to disintegrate, then the spindle fibre would not reach the chromosomes.

b. Duplication of DNA does not occur, then the whole cell cycle would get arrested and will enter an inactive stage called the G0 stage.

c. Centromeres do not divide- Sister chromatids would not split to opposite poles, and one daughter cell would get two sister chromatids, whereas the other will get none.

d. Cytokinesis does not occur- It will result in polyploidy.

**8. Both unicellular and multicellular organisms undergo mitosis. What are the differences, if any, observed in the process between the two?**

**Solution:**

In prokaryotes, amitosis takes place, the cell directly divides into two daughter cells. Whereas in multicellular organisms, proper steps of cell division occur; first the karyokinesis takes place then cytokinesis occurs.

**9. Name the pathological condition when uncontrolled cell division occurs.**

**Solution:**

This is called malignancy caused due to cancer.

**10. Two key events take place, during S phase in animal cells, DNA replication and duplication of the centriole. In which parts of the cell do events occur?**

**Solution:**

DNA replication occurs in the nucleus and centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm.

**11. Comment on the statement – Meiosis enables the conservation of specific chromosome number of each species even though the process per se, results in a reduction of chromosome number.**

**Solution**:

A diploid zygote is formed when the two haploid cells called gametes fused during fertilization. If meiosis is absent than two diploid gametes would be produced which will result in the formation of tetraploid zygote. To conserve the chromosome, number meiosis is very important.

**12. Name a cell that is found arrested in diplotene stage for months and years. Comment in 2-3 lines how it completes the cell cycle?**

**Solution:**

The oocyte of mammalian females gets arrested in the diplotene stage. The oocyte grows and forms secondary follicle and then it gets arrested at the diplotene stage. As the woman attains sexual maturity first, meiosis gets completed. Meiosis occurs one by one in the egg, which is released from the ovary.

**13. How does cytokinesis in plant cells differ from that in animal cells?**

**Solution:**

Cytokinesis in plants occurs by cell plate formation. Cell plate formation starts from the centre and grows to the periphery.

**LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS**

**1. Comment on the statement – Telophase is reverse of prophase.**

**Solution:**

In Prophase- Chromosome condenses. The nuclear membrane disintegrates. Organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus disappears. Cells at the end of prophase do not show Golgi complexes, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleolus. The chromosome clusters will be surrounded by the nuclear envelope at the telophase stage.

**2. What are the various stages of meiotic prophase-I? Enumerate the chromosomal events during each stage.**

**Solution:**

Prophase I-

a. Leptotene stage:

• Nuclear membrane starts to disappear.

• Chromatin material starts condensing.

• Centriole reaches opposite poles.

• In some members of Liliaceae, chromosomes remain attached to the nuclear membrane–bouquet stage.

b. Zygotene:

• Pairing of homologous chromosomes start.

• To hold these homologous chromosomes a protein called synaptonemal complex develops.

c. Pachytene

• Biavalent \[homologous chromosomes] or tetrad becomes visible.

• Crossing over takes place resulting in genetic recombination.

• The enzyme recombinase, for crossing over comes from the recombination nodule of the synaptonemal complex.

d. Diplotene

• Synoptenemal complex dissolves

• But homologous chromosomes are still held by an X-like structure called the chiasma.

• Chiasmata develops at the point of crossing over.

e. Diakinesis

• Terminalisation of chiasmata: Chiasmata starts opening in a zipper-like fashion towards the periphery

• Nuclear membrane and nucleolus nearly disappear.

**3. Differentiate between the events of mitosis and meiosis.**

**Solution:**

MITOSIS

1. Prophase will be short duration
2. Only a single metaphasis plate is formed during metaphase.
3. Sister chromatids tend to move opposite pole during anaphase
4. Cytokinesis occurs after mitosis

MEIOSIS

1. Prophase I is a long duration and prophase II is a short duration
2. Metaphase I – two metaphasic plates and Metaphase II is a single metaphasic.
3. Two homologous chromatids separate during anaphase I.
4. It doesn’t occur after meiosis I, occurs after meiosis II

**4. Write a brief note on the following** **a. Synaptonemal complex** **b. Metaphase plate** **Solution:** a. Synaptonemal complex It is made up of protein formed between two homologous chromosomes. The complex formed during zygotene which is the substage of Prophase I. It contains a recombination nodule which consists of enzyme recombinase involved in crossing over. b. Metaphase plate The metaphase plate is the imaginary line which is formed in the centre of the cell during metaphase. The chromosomes will get close to the spindle fibres and align themselves on the plate. The movement of chromosomes towards the metaphase plate is called congression. **5. Write briefly the significance of mitosis and meiosis in a multicellular organism.** **Solution:** Mitosis creates the cells necessary to add more mass to the body, as well as more cells to cope with the growth, such as new blood cells. In case of injury, mitosis is involved in the healing of the tissues. Meiosis also produces genetic variation by way of the process of recombination. It helps to conserve the no. of chromosomes in a species. **6. An organism has two pair of chromosomes (i.e., chromosome number = 4). Diagrammatically represent the chromosomal arrangement during different phases of meiosis-II.** **Solution:**

Cell cycle and cell division are a few different processes that form a part of your body. The tendency of two daughter cells to multiply from a single parent cell is termed Cell division. Prokaryotic cells rely on the process of binary fission, while Eukaryotic cells rely on the process of mitosis. The cell cycle can be defined as the events which take place during the process of cell division.

* Prophase – Prophase is the first stage of mitosis.
* Metaphase – The second stage of mitosis is metaphase, where sister chromatids are formed.
* Anaphase – The third stage of mitosis is anaphase, where the splitting of centromeres takes place, and the sister chromatids move to opposite poles.
* Telophase – The fourth stage in mitosis is telophase, where the chromosome cluster is covered with the nuclear envelope.
* Cycle 1 is called meiosis 1, and the second cycle is called meiosis 2.

#### Why does Meiosis 2 occur?

![Image.png](https://microbenotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Phases-of-Meiosis-II.png)

Meiosis I produces two new cells, each haploid in their DNA, but with 2 copies. These cells take a short rest before entering the second division of meiosis, meiosis II. In meiosis II, the duplicated chromosomes align on a second spindle, and the sister chromatids separate to produce cells with a haploid DNA content. Telophase 2 is basically splitting the 2 sisters apart, but, as each contains the same genetic info, it is still haploid. In meiosis 1, homologous chromosomes separate from each other, whereas, in meiosis 2, sister chromatids separate.
