## Questions

1. If a = 2t + 1, find the average velocity.
2. If a = 2t^2 + 1, find average acceleration between t=1 sec to t =3 sec.
3. A car is moving with a velocity of 25 m/s. It undergoes a retardation of a = -2$$\sqrt{v}$$. Find the time at which it comes to rest.

## Quick Overview

1. General Common Sense Qs
2. Distance vs Displacement
3. Speed
   * Uniform Speed
   * Non-uniform Speed
   * Instantaneous Speed → Measured by Speedometer
   * Average Speed
