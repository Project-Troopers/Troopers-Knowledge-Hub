### How to ideally study for a Physics exam?

The first thing is to go through the syllabus and make a SWOT analysis. We’re human, so we’re bound to have a few weak points.

*   Accordingly, divide your time into three parts.

    1. Strengths and Opportunities
    2. Weaknesses
    3. Threats

    By dividing it into three, you can focus on a few things better.
* It all depends on the weightage. Now if your Weakness and Threats out-weigh your opportunities, let it take precedence while studying.
