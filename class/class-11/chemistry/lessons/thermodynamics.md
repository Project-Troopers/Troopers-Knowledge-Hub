## Quick Overview

1. Thermodynamics, the important terms
   * The System
   * The Surroundings
   * The Universe
   * The Types of Systems
     * Open System
     * Closed System
     * Isolated System
2. The State of the System
   * Path functions and State functions

| **Feature**              | **State function**                              | **Path function**                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Dependence on path       | Independent                                     | Dependent                                            |
| Description              | Depends only on the current state of the system | Depends on the path taken to reach the current state |
| Result of multiple paths | Multiple paths can result in the same value     | Multiple paths may result in different values        |
| Examples                 | Temperature, pressure, volume, internal energy  | Heat, work                                           |

  1. Pressure
  2. Volume
  3. Temperature
  4. Internal Energy
     - Work done
     - Heat
        - Conventions by IUPAC
     - The General case (The First Law of Thermodynamics)

        $$\triangle U = q \; + \; w$$

        Or another modification is present too.

  1. Enthalpy
  2. Entropy
  3. Heat Capacity
  4. Gibbs Energy
```

2\. The Applications of the First Law

* Work done
  * Getting the General work done formula from physics
  * Converting it into terms of pressure
  * Taking and considering external pressure to be constant
  * Volume as a variable reference.
  * Adjusting it for IUPAC Conventions
  * The concept of Total Work done
  * Getting the newer, more adjusted formula for processes.
    * Conversion of external pressure into internal reference; using the idea of equilibrium.
    * Using the ideal gas equation to convert it into a more calculable reference
  * The concept of free expansion and Isothermal process
  * The concept of Isochoric Process
* Enthalpy
  * The concept of Enthalpy as a state function
  * The General equation of enthalpy (which is also the alternative equation of the First Law)
  * Conventions of Enthalpy
  * Extensive and Intensive Properties \[Not to be confused with state functions]
  * Heat Capacity and Specific Heat, Molar Heat Capacity
  * The relationship between $$C_p$$ and $$C_v$$ for an ideal gas
  * The different standard enthalpies

4. Born-Haber Cycle
5. Entropy
6. Gibbs Energy (Free Energy)
