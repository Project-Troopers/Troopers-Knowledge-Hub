# Novel Review

> Speaking Skill Activity - 2 Due in the month of January, after PE 3

## Directives

* This activity is a speaking skill activity that students are required to complete in the month of November. The directive for the activity is to choose a classical novel and seek approval from the teacher before proceeding. Some examples of classical novels provided are those by Jane Austen, Shakespeare, and Alexandre Dumas.
* Once the novel is chosen, students should read it and analyze its characteristics. This involves examining various aspects of the book, such as its plot, themes, characters, and writing style. Students should pay attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the novel, noting its merits and demerits.
* After analyzing the novel, students are required to create a speech about it and its writing style. The speech should be engaging and include witty remarks throughout. Students should discuss the climax and anti-climax of the novel, highlighting key moments of tension and resolution. Additionally, the speech should conclude with the student's personal view or opinion of the novel.
* Finally, students are expected to present their speeches in class when specified. This allows them to practice their speaking skills and share their thoughts on the selected classical novel with their peers.
