# Listening Activity 1

[Listening | LearnEnglish Teens](https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/skills/listening)

## Objective

To grade a student's listening skills and provide the necessary constructive feedback

## Directive

* Two exercises will be presented to the students.
* The first exercise will be for 14 marks in total and the second will be graded for 12 marks.
* If you are unable to attend the listening skill test, a re-test will be taken along with Class 12 students too.

## Marking Scheme

* Earning more than 10 marks in each exercise will be considered as full marks.
* This will be binned down to 5 marks each, and they will be considered for Periodic Exam 2's internals.
* If one has earned less than 10 in a exercise, then the marks they have been awarded will assumed for 10 marks.

> **Hall of Fame**

* > Ms. Ishana Santhosh has bagged full marks in both the listening skill exercises.
