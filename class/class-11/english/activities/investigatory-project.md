    Do not be direct with questions that ask a person about their personal details or violate their privacy. Try to be as gentle as possible. E.g. Financial - How much do you earn per month? (Instead of asking them to fill in the exact salary, give them a scale on which they can select their income range.)

    The interview can be held in any language, but it must be transcribed to English before attaching it as a part of the report. Record your interviews for evidence, if possible.

    Your aim will be to substantiate your claims in the essay with this exercise; along with research evidence.

    E.g. of an online questionnaire:-

5.  **Report** - Consolidate a report of your findings in a single page. It can be printed out and use pie charts or bar graphs from the results of the survey. You’re supposed to take relevant data (effectively filtering out the personally identifiable data such as name etc and some basic data), type or write it out in one full side/page (both the minimum and maximum no of pages you’re allowed to use - i.e your report should cover one full side completely). Add pie charts and bar graphs from your survey results in the report.

    Remember, only the survey data that you declare/infer here are the ones that you can use in your essay.
6. **Essay:** Based on your research and inferences in the report, you are supposed to write an essay for 500 words (i.e 4 sides/pages). It should be handwritten and submitted to the teacher for review when necessitated. It should be written in blue ink completely and you decorate the borders. It is the culmination of your research and inferences of the questionnaire that you have portrayed in the report.
7. **Essay, Interview/Questionnaire Results & Report submission** - On 30/11/2023 - Ma’am will make the necessary corrections and give it back to you in 3-4 days’ time.
8. **Portfolio** - After your content has been approved by the teacher, softly bound your findings into a neat portfolio, with a blue spine/soft bound. Submit it by 10/1/2024. It should/can contain (not necessarily in this you order)

  * If your interview is a physical or digital interview, try your best to record the interview and write the exact transcript on paper or in a digital format. It is not necessary to include a full transcript, so redact personal information as and when required. You can include custom questions, but only if the teacher has approved them previously.
  * If your questionnaire is a physical handout, then attach the physical handouts as part of the portfolio.
  * If your questionnaire is digital, attach the responses separately or attach a combined report.
