### Note Making Format

Taking notes is a method of organizing and summarizing data from multiple sources. The following components make up the standard **note-taking format**:

* **TITLE:** The title of your notes should reflect their main subject matter.
* **USE Numbered Lists:** Use numbered lists to highlight key points and specifics in a list. Use simple, direct language, and zero in on the most important ideas rather than trying to include everything.
* **USE ABBREVIATIONS:** When taking notes, abbreviations can help you save time and space. Use “w/” instead of “with” or “b/c” instead of “because,” etc.
* **HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT POINTS:** Utilize highlighting to draw attention to specific points or single out specific pieces of information that are crucial to your understanding of the whole.
* **SUMMARISE:** Write a brief paragraph or two summarizing the main ideas and information from the notes. This is a great way to quickly review and recall the most crucial points.
* **REVIEW:** Regularly reviewing your notes is an excellent way to ensure that you retain the most crucial information from the passage.

## Tips for Effective Note-Making

> “It’s the quality, and not the quantity, that matters.”

Before you begin note-making, it is essential to follow a few key steps in order to create organised and comprehensive notes. By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your notes are elaborate, polished, and professional.

1. **Thoroughly Read the Passage:** Begin by reading the entire passage fully. This will allow you to gain a holistic understanding of the content, making it easier to identify the main ideas and key points.
2. **Identify Main Ideas:** Once you have familiarised yourself with the passage, start identifying the main ideas. These are the overarching concepts or themes that the author is conveying. Highlight or underline these main ideas to separate them from the supporting details.
3. **Focus on Sub-Points:** After identifying the main ideas, shift your attention to the supporting details or sub-points. These provide additional information and examples that further develop the main ideas. Note down these sub-points, ensuring that they are concise and clearly linked to the corresponding main ideas.
4. **Omit Examples and Anecdotes:** While reading the passage, you may come across examples or anecdotes. It is important to ignore these when creating your notes. (for the exam) Instead, focus on capturing the essential information related to the main ideas and sub-points.
5. **Utilize Abbreviations and Symbols (worth 2 marks):** To enhance the efficiency of your note-making, make use of abbreviations and symbols. This can help you save time and space while also making your notes more concise. Ensure that you include at least five different abbreviations and symbols (just so that the examiner will award you with full credit), and always remember to place a full stop after each abbreviation for it to be considered valid. Some examples are “Sch.” for school and “Dev.” for development.
6. **Stick to Length Guidelines:** To maintain a professional and organized appearance, adhere to the length guidelines provided. Your note-making should not exceed two pages, while being at least 1.5 pages in length. This will demonstrate your ability to summarize and condense information effectively.
7. **Maintain a Formal Tone:** When creating your notes, it is crucial to maintain a formal tone. Avoid using colloquial language or informal expressions. Instead, opt for a professional and academic writing style that conveys your understanding and competence in the subject matter.

By following these tips for effective note-making, you can ensure that your content feels more elaborate, polished, and professional in the examination. Remember to approach the process with focus and attention to detail, resulting in comprehensive and visually appealing notes.

> **Example:-**

> B**reakfast**

1.  > Introduction

    > 1.1. First meal of the day

    > 1.2. Breaks the fast of the night
2.  > Different ways in which people break the fast

    > 2.1. North India

    > 2.2. South India

    > 2.3. Americas
3.  > Need for a good breakfast

    > 3.1. Sets the pattern for the day

    > 3.2. Gives energy

    > 3.3. Rejuvenates the body

In short;

1. Read through the passage fully.
2. Identify the main ideas → Main points
3. The information about the main ideas → Sub-points
4. Ignore examples, anecdotes
5. Use Abbreviations (at least 5) and Symbols. It is worth 2 marks. When you write the abbreviations, always remember to place a full stop after each abbreviation for it to be considered as an abbreviation. Eg: Sch. , Dev. , etc.
6. Your note-making should not exceed 2 pages, and should be at least 1.5 pages.
7. Ensure that the tone is formal.

## Tips for Writing an Effective Summary

When crafting a summary, it is important to keep it concise and focused. Follow these guidelines to create a professional and polished summary:

1. **Simplify Main Ideas:** Condense each main idea into a single, succinct line. By distilling the primary concepts, you will capture the essence of the passage efficiently.
2. **Avoid Overloading:** Resist the temptation to include all the details provided in the sub-points. Instead, include only the most crucial information, using very few supporting details.
3. **Length Considerations:** Ensure that your summary does not exceed one-third of the length of the original passage. Ideally, it should not exceed half a page of your paper.
4. **Maintain Proportions:** For main points with three sub-points, aim to use two to three sentences to summarise the key details. For instance, if you have five main points with three sub-points each, limit yourself to a maximum of 15 sentences for the entire summary.
5. **Be Concise:** The summary should be crisp and to the point. Avoid unnecessary fluff or wordiness, using clear and concise language to convey the main ideas effectively.

By following these tips, you can create a well-crafted summary that captures the essential information without overwhelming the reader.

In short,

* Write each main idea as one line.
* Don’t try to include all the information given in the sub-points, include v. little
* It should be 1/3rd of the main passage at maximum and it should not exceed 1/2 a page (side) of your paper.
*   The right proportions:-

    For every main point which has 3 sub-points, use 2-3 sentences Eg: For 5 main points with sub-points each, use a total maximum of 15 sentences.
* The summary should be crisp.

## A true Example

### The passage

1. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become commonplace. When it comes to medicine, AI helps surgeons to streamline tasks, improve operational efficiencies and simplify complex procedures.
2. Despite its potential to unlock new insights, AI may bring considerable threats of privacy, ethical concerns, and medical errors. The need is of a human-artificial intelligence interface, the knowledge- handler and the empathetic communicator.
3. Although AI has come a long way in the medical world, human surveillance is still essential. For example, surgery robots operate logically, as opposed to empathetically. Surgeons may notice vital behavioral observations that can help diagnose or prevent medical complications. AI can identify potential ailments faster than human doctors, but when it comes to decision-making, AI cannot yet fully and safely surpass human physicians. AI cannot adapt to the variety of situations arising during a difficult surgery as it has a pre-fixed analytic, but a surgeon can not only adapt to the situation, but find new ways on the operating table to save a person’s life.
4. Despite the fact that robots are in many ways seen as more accurate and reliable than human surgeons, people are inevitably worried about putting their lives in the hands of a machine. Fears surrounding the safety and accuracy of procedures are prevalent among members of the public, however it is highly likely that the widespread use of medical robotics is set to continue.
5. AI is a new tool and can perform more complicated tasks and detect minor errors which can be missed by humans, but there are costs and risks if it is utilized incorrectly. There is always some scope for human error or mechanical failure with these advanced robots. A single mechanical malfunction can cost human lives.

### Summary

Commonplace AI has found it's ways into the medical system. It helps surgeons to streamline tasks, improve operation efficiencies and simplify complex procedures. However, there are new challenges posed by AI. They are the ever-growing threats of privacy, medial and ethical errors. So, the need of the hour is to shift our understanding as using AI as helpers, not as the ones in-charge. Human-AI interface, knowledge-handler and communicators can help alleviate some of these concerns, since AI works logically while humans rely on emotions and observe behavioural patterns. Its faster processing comes with the cost of reduced accuracy, safety and stunted creativity, qualities which are needed on the operating table to save human lives. Due to this, people do not trust AI with their life. It is imperative to note that AI can detect minor overlooked errors in operations, but mechanical and human errors are still possible, potentially costing a lot of lives. Thus, humans must be in the driver's seat when it comes to taking decisions in medical scenarios.
