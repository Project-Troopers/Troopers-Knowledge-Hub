# Classified Ad

Classified ads are placed by individuals wishing to advertise goods and services available or needed. The ads, as their name implies, are grouped according to the product or service type. Classified advertisers are billed by the word or the line; and only small slots are present or given by the editor. As a result, classified ads are generally brief and descriptive.

To write an effective classified advertisement, remember these tips:

* Create a catchy title for your ad.
* Add a border around your ad for a professional appearance.
* Use short phrases instead of complete sentences. Ensure that the information in your ad is concise, relevant, and avoids unnecessary drama.
* Keep your sentences brief and grammatically simple to avoid unnecessary charges. Omit articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and other unnecessary words.
* Match the tone, mood, mode, and style of your ad with the title and subject matter.
* Use symbols and abbreviations as needed, but only use full stops for punctuation.
* Avoid including personal names in ads for security reasons, unless it is a Missing or Lost case.
* Always include contact information and write the designation of the authorised point of contact wherever necessary.

Ads are generally used to reach out to people, in hopes of increased social engagement and response. An entity places an ad to satisfy a particular need/want. All newspapers have a section for classified Ads.
