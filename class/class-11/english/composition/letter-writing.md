    > Can you create functional, green spaces in a crowded city like Mumbai ? ‘Fresh and Local’ is an initiative to transform underused spaces into productive, community areas through urban farming. It aims to inspire city residents to make the most use of the spaces that surround them to grow fruits, herbs and vegetables. Not only can urban farming improve the environment, but also the health of the city residents.
