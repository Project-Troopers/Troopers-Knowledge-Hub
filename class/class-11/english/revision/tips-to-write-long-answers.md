# Tips to write Long Answers

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before we start…**\
It important to understand the logic to write short answers. It can give you enough experience to write long answers well.

* 2 or 3 marks → 3 Value Points in 4 lines (like just around half the side of a horizontally long answer sheet.)
* Follow the CPT strategy → Be **Concise**, **Precise** and **To** the Point

## General Tips

The following rubric will be used to grade you for your English exams. (Class 11 and Class 12)

| **S. No** | **Criteria**               | **Marks**   |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1.        | Flow of Ideas / Sequencing | 2           |
| 2.        | Expression                 | 2           |
| 3.        | Content                    | 2           |
|           | **Total:**                 | **6 marks** |

Out of the total of 6 marks, you will be awarded a general maximum of 5.5 marks. The rest will only be awarded if your answer is exceptional. (in other words, perfect)

If they're using an alternative rubric, then this would be it: (generally used for Class 9 and Class 10)

| **S. No** | **Criteria**                             | **Marks**     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1.        | Fluency of the Language and Presentation | 1             |
| 2.        | Flow of Ideas                            | 1.5           |
| 3.        | Relevancy                                | 2             |
| 4.        | Grammatical Accuracy                     | 1             |
|           | **Total:**                               | **5.5 marks** |

### Flow of Ideas / Sequencing

I personally call this part as "creating a unified singular main linking road".

* Coherency of Ideas matter
* Integrity of your own ideas
* Pertinent use of linking words such as "Firstly", "However", "Therefore", "Subsequently", "Consequently"

{% hint style="success" %}
The questions you should be asking yourself are:-

1. Is it in order?
2. Does it make sense?
3. Does it have that creative spark and remarkable expression?
4. Is it concise?
5. Is it neat?
6. Is it written in at least 3-4 paragraphs?
7. Does it exceed 1.25 vertically long pages (or 2 horizontally long pages)?

### Expression

* Proper usage of simple, compound, complex sentences.
* Level and Fluency of English used (Eg: Writing "I commute by car." instead of "I travel by car." can fetch you more marks.)
* Grammar and Accuracy
* Use the same tense throughout a paragraph/answer/essay. Switch tenses only when it is imperative to do so.
* It is not necessary to write an entire summary of the lesson, only include what is necessary.
* Basically, how did the examiner feel after reading your answer.

### Content

* Substantiate your answers with reference to the text.
* Writing only pertinent details.
* Encompassing a broader view, and thus, a deeper knowledge and understanding of the subject and lesson. (Eg: Just meting out a summary of the lesson will not fetch you marks. You have to talk about the broader view, bringing in general knowledge and facts.)
* Factual accuracy

In the Board exams, if you cross 75/80; then around 30 teachers will scrutinise your paper and find any minor errors that can be used to decrease your score.

1.  **Character Sketch**

    * Character's Place
    * Physical Appearance
    * Mental "Insider" Description → Personality Traits
    * Character's impact (on the story & other characters)
    * Social Setup, theme and environment around the person
    * Personal Behaviour
    * Treatment of Others
    * Consequences and Responsibility
    * Conclusion and Contribution
    * Is the character the "protagonist" or "antagonist"?

    > **Learning points** → What you learn from the character
2.  **Value-based Questions**

    * Development of the Character from the start to the end of the story
    * Typically, these questions involve proverbs or sayings.
    * Explain the proverb/saying/value
    * **Connect it to the story:** Give evidence that plot/character followed this value.
    * Connect to today's society

    > **Spotlight:** The tale of Melon City (Hornbill - Class 11)
3.  **Multiple characters/lessons/values**

    Now if a question asks us (directly or indirectly) to compare between characters or lessons or values , we must give:-

    * a general explanation of the value
    * link values with the characters
    * link it to the present day
    * conclude (with solution if needed)

    > **Spotlight:** Suppose a question asks us to explain about parenthood by drawing comparisons between the 'Father' from "Father to Son", Joe Morgan from "Birth", the 'bird' from "The Laburnum Top" and George Pearson from "Mother's Day"; we can:

    * > portray the differences in parenting "styles" (for e.g. The bird vs George Pearson… The bird tends to be extremely caring while George sets an example of 'what could go wrong' if the parents do not place checks and balances on the life of kids)
    * > discuss the concept of an "ideal parent".
    * > shed light on the emotions experienced by parents (using examples like Joe Morgan's anticipation and anxiety before his child's birth.)
    * > Use quotes or thought-provoking ideas (Eg: "Parents have to go beyond the call of duty to meet their children's needs.")
4.  **Title Justification:-**

    Here's a general outline:

    **1st Para:** Introduction and Include the Literal Meaning **2nd Para:** Contextual Meaning **3rd Para:** Refer to context (by pulling out references) **4th Para:** Conclusion (2 to 3 lines)

### Questions

1.  With the advancement of time, the education system has developed and changed so much. Do you think that the old generation feels helpless realizing it? What kind of difficulties do they face?

    > **Thinking Process:-**

    > The question includes three parts:-

    1. > How has the education system changed?
    2. > Old vs New - differences
    3. > Difficulties faced by the elder generation in understanding the current education system.

    > **Plan:-**

    1. > Use quotes. Justify that the education system has changed. NEP 2020. NCF 2023. Rote learning vs. Skill-based education.
       * > Streams in Class 8
       * > Improve expertise and apply
       * > Eliminating redundant data
       * > Soft skills… etc. Holistic development
    2. > Old vs New Education System & People
    3. > How will the older generation relate to this new education system? The difficulties? Take instances from “The Portrait of a Lady by Khushwant Singh”. (An average of 3 lines) Rote learning and Mug-it-up vs Skills. Eg: Khushwant Singh… and how it ends up affecting interpersonal relationships.
    4. > Conclusion: Eg - The New Edu System has done nothing to improve the connections between the old and the new.

    > **The Detailed Plan:-**

    > **Example:-**

    > _The following example is AI generated. Use this only as a starting point for your answers. This example is missing a few points that would make it perfect._

    > "The education system has undergone significant changes with the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the proposed National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023. These reforms aim to shift the focus from rote learning to skill-based education, promoting holistic development among students.

    > The introduction of streams in Class 8 allows students to explore and improve their expertise in specific areas. This enables them to apply their knowledge practically, enhancing their problem-solving and critical thinking abilities. By eliminating redundant data and promoting a more focused approach, the new education system aims to empower students with relevant skills for the future.

    > In this new era of education, soft skills hold great significance. The emphasis on holistic development ensures that students not only excel in academics but also acquire essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. This comprehensive approach prepares students to face the challenges of the modern world.

    > However, the transition from the old to the new education system presents difficulties for the older generation. The traditional approach of rote learning and mugging-up information has been deeply ingrained in their education. Consequently, they may struggle to understand and adapt to the skill-based approach, which focuses on practical application and critical thinking.

    > In the story, 'The Portrait of a Lady,' we witness the consequences of a rigid education system on interpersonal relationships. The character of Khushwant Singh’s grandmother, for instance, illustrates how the reliance on rote learning can hinder the acceptance of a newer education system that can offer surprisingly better advantages. This divide between the old and the new education system reflects the challenges faced by the older generation in relating to the changing dynamics.

    > In conclusion, while the new education system aims to bring about positive transformations, it has yet to effectively bridge the gap between the old and the new. The difficulties faced by the older generation in adapting to the skill-based approach, as illustrated in 'The Portrait of a Lady,' highlight the need for a more inclusive and supportive transition process. It is crucial to ensure that the benefits of the new education system are experienced by all, fostering a harmonious connection between generations."
2.  Rain gets life from and gives life back to the Earth. Human Beings should learn from nature and follow in its footsteps. Comment upon this statement with reference to the poem “The Voice of the Rain”.

    > **What does the examiner expect you to talk about?**

    * > The G20 summit, the COP23 submit.
    * > Global warming
    * > The delicate balance between Humans, Nature and the Rain

    > **Plan: DIY**
