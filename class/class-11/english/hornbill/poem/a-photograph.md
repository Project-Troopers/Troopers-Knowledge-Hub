## Let's start with a small activity.

### Characterise your emotion through a picture and two poetic lines; and compare the differences

**Here’s a good example:-**

> “I swift through problems and content and code, \
> wondering which would give me the curiosity I desire and deserve.”

[**The following prompt was used to generate the AI images given below**: Characterise the emotion and the situation through digital art: “I swift through problems and content and code, wondering which would give me the curiosity I desire and deserve.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]"

**Pictorial Description:-**

> I am sitting in front of a computer sifting through settings, information and code; wondering what would help me solve stuff. I am immediately in a forest, taking pictures and notes about animals.

The above description was used to create the AI images given below.

<div>

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Now when you compare the poetic lines and the picture; you can sense that the poetic lines have a huge well of emotion; while the pictorial description does not. The pictorial description has no emotion attached to it. Even when you compare the images generated by AI from the poetic lines and pictorial description, you can see the difference.

So, in effect, we understand that a **poem, though it is just another form of** expression, it _is_ a prose that delivers emotions and beauty through the richness of the language used (regardless of whether it is English, Hindi or Tamil etc.)

## Building the base

This poem mainly talks about the nostalgia and the mix of emotions that the poet experiences upon seeing a simple, but meaningful piece of photograph on a piece of Cardboard.

The main function of a photograph is to freeze and preserve moments of time. It helps us to recall memories and emotion. In the past, we used to take meaningful photographs. We used to share those nostalgic moments with others, making our own witty comments along the way. But, with the advent of digital photography and smartphones through the development of the photograph industry, we tend to take photos of all random moments, and we tend to not share them with anyone anymore.

Thus, we lose that physical touch, that physical connection between tangible elements of the present and the past.

> "Death can silence you and leave you speechless."

</div>

**AI Generated images. Prompt:** Now create an image that expresses the quote "Death can silence you and leave you speechless."

The moment we lose our loved ones, we find that our hope is shattered and we come to the sudden realisation that everything on Earth is not permanent. Sure, we would have lost things, and memories too; but the loss of a person is grave blow to our "frenzied" understanding of the world.

They say that there are four stages of grief, each varying from person to person. In the context of this lesson, here is a variation of that statement:

$$
Shock \; \longrightarrow \; Not \; accepting \; \longrightarrow \; Deep \; grief \; and \; anger \; \longrightarrow \; Nostalgia
$$

</div>

**AI Generated images. Prompt:** Digital art, Create an image that depicts the four stages of grief: Shock, Not accepting, Deep grief and anger, Nostalgia

We feel upset when we feel that loss of a loved one. But, we fail to understand that there is life after death, just not in way that we think. People can live on through the memories, the photographs, the impact that they had on people in shaping world history.

And some things can be considered to be permanent too. The Sea, The Earth, The Universe and The Sun are all “permanent” things when compared to our lives. It is these eternal forces that have seen and experienced all the life that has every lived on Earth throughout its history.

That is what this whole poem talks about in depth.

## Poetic Devices

Poetic devices are key elements in writing that add depth, complexity, and artistic flair to a piece of literature. They serve to enhance the reader's experience and captivate their attention. One such device is allusion, which refers to the use of a reference to evoke a specific idea or concept. In the context of this poem, the cardboard alludes to the photograph, suggesting that the image on the cardboard holds symbolic meaning or significance.

1. **Allusion:** The cardboard alludes to the photograph
2. **Rhyming Scheme**: Free Verse
3. **Alliteration**: "Stood still to smile"
4. **Anti-thesis**: laboured ease of loss
5. **Oxymoron:** "terribly transient"
6. **Transferred Epithet**: "Terribly transient feet"
7. **Enjambment:** Para 1 → Lines 1 to 2, Lines 5 to 6; Para 2 → completely; Para 3 → Line 1-2, Lines 2-3
8. **Personification**: 'silence silences"

In detail;

1. The **rhyming scheme** employed in this poem is free verse, which allows for flexibility and creativity in the arrangement of words and phrases. Unlike traditional poetic forms with specific patterns of rhyme and meter, free verse offers the poet the freedom to experiment and deviate from established conventions, resulting in a more organic and less predictable structure.
2. The use of **allusion** is evident through the reference to the photograph being symbolically represented by the cardboard material. This literary device subtly suggests a connection between the two entities, allowing for a deeper understanding and interpretation of the subject matter.
3. **Alliteration**, another poetic device, is the repetition of sounds at the beginning of words in close proximity. In this poem, the phrase "_stood still to smile_" exhibits alliteration, creating a musical quality and drawing attention to the act of standing and smiling.
4. The use of **antithesis** is also notable in this text. By combining contrasting or contradictory ideas, the poet creates a sense of tension and contrast. In this case, the line "labored ease of loss" suggests a paradoxical state, where the pain and difficulty of losing someone is juxtaposed with a sense of calm or acceptance.
5. An **oxymoron**, as seen in the phrase "terribly transient," is the combination of contradictory terms or ideas. This particular example describes something as both "terrible" and "transient," suggesting a fleeting yet intense quality, further emphasizing the ephemeral nature of the subject being described.
6. **Transferred epithet** is a device that attributes a characteristic to a noun that would typically be associated with a different noun. The phrase "terribly transient feet" exemplifies this, as the adjective "terribly" is transferred from the feet to describe the transient nature of the subject.
7. **Enjambment**, another important poetic device, occurs when a sentence or phrase continues onto the next line without any pause or punctuation. In this poem, the use of enjambment is evident in several instances, such as in the first and second lines of the first paragraph, and the second and third lines of the third paragraph. This technique creates a sense of fluidity, blurring the boundaries between lines and allowing the ideas to flow seamlessly from one to the next.
8. Lastly, the poem incorporates **personification**, attributing human qualities to the phrase "silence silences". Silence possesses the remarkable ability to produce a serene effect. In its ethereal and enigmatic demeanor, silence exerts a profound influence over its surroundings, commanding a sense of stillness and tranquility. It is as if silence has a sentient quality, effortlessly imposing a hushed ambiance that engulfs the space in which it exists. This personification highlights the powerful impact of silence, illuminating its transformative effect on the human experience. Through its agency to silence, silence becomes an entity to be revered, emphasizing its capacity to evoke introspection, contemplation, and serenity.

## Theme

The poem is a nostalgic rendition of the poet's mother. The poet comes across a photograph taken of her mother's childhood. She is filled with both sadness and joy at the memories the photograph brings on. The poem compares the unchanging sea with the brevity (shortness) of human life.
