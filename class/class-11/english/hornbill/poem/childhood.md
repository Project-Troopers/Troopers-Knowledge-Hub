## Prequel to the poem

Every person goes through different stages of life. They are:-

1. Infancy
2. Toddler
3. Childhood
4. Adolescence
5. Adult

We tend to chuck morals in during childhood. Until then, the person is oblivious to the surroundings and in essence, is very "innocent".

> The process of growing up involves us losing our innocence.

> "All the words on the stageâ€¦ and we're merely just actors."

* Shakespeare

Each person tends to play, study, work, travel and settle in a place for life.

When a child grows up, he is disillusioned by the environment, by the society and by his own family (genetics).

### How do you handle your problem?

The way a person handles a situation depends on the emotional quotient of a person. People will trample on your emotions, and use your emotions to make you their slaves. There will be no sympathy and no empathy in the real world.

But, let's face the truth - today's youth don't have enough emotional tolerance. They are easily manipulated by Social Media, movies, and friends. This leads them into thinking that an ideal life is possible, in terms of love, life and sacrifice. However, the moment they realise that those ideologies are not true, they tend to lose their aim and their life in the process of coping up with those ideological breakdowns.

### Why does today's youth have very little emotional tolerance?

Think about this and come back with ideasâ€¦
