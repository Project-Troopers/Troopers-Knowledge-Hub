## Theme

The tale of Melon City is a satirical poem with a serious underlying message. It deals with the idea that justice is an acknowledged virtue, but if the notion of justice is carried too far, it proves to be self-defeating. The king is portrayed as an indecisive ruler rather than a man of rational thought. Vikram Seth shows the importance of a balanced ruler who guides his people.

## Points to note

* The Arch symbolises tyranny and tries to invoke a false sense of awe, wonder and gratification.
* It is better for a king to do nothing rather than doing something to satiate his pride. It will allow the people to live in peace and quiet.
* No one should ever be too placid. There’s a season to hustle, a season to rest and a season to guard what we have left.
* POPULARITY STUNT: Times will come and go.... and a time will come when we will have to choose between doing the right thing or the easy thing (which might be popular)
* Laissez faire: Democracy is much better than one person. having control of it all. It might be slow and can't bring speedy reforms, but provides much more stability than alternatives.
* JUSTICE: "Right, even if everyone is against it, and wrong is wrong, even if everyone is for it"WILLIAM PENN!
