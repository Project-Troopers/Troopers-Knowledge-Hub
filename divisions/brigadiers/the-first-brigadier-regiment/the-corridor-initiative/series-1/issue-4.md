### DID YOU KNOW THAT?

1. A photon even though travelling at the speed of light takes approximately 10,000 to 100 million years just to get out of the Sun due to the sun’s immense pressure.
2. A spoon of dust from a Neutron star is enough to rip the earth into pieces.
3. You can in real life actually travel to the future if you orbit a black hole.
4. The matter with which feel and touch accounts for only 5% the mass of the entire universe and that Dark matter and Dark energy accounts for 26% and 69% of the mass respectively.

## Exploring Craters on the Moon

### Materials

* Large baking pan or shallow cardboard box
* Flour (enough to fill the pan)
* Cocoa powder (enough to create a thin layer on top of the flour)
* Sieve or sifter
* Balls of various sizes
* Optional: ruler and meter stick

### Instructions

1. Fill the baking pan with flour.

2. Use the sieve to put a thin layer of cocoa powder on top of the flour.
3. Try dropping a ball into the pan from about half a meter above it (optionally, use the meter stick so you can drop from a consistent height).
4. Look at the resulting impact crater. What color is the surface immediately around the crater? How does that compare to the surface of the rest of the pan? How far did the flour and cocoa powder spread? Optionally, use the ruler to measure these distances.

5. Try dropping the same ball from a different height. What does the resulting crater look like?
6. Try dropping balls of different sizes from the same height, and examine the resulting craters.
7. You can even try throwing a ball sideways so it hits the pan at an angle, instead of coming straight down. How is the resulting impact pattern different from when you dropped the balls straight down?
8. If needed, smooth out the surface of the pan, and sift a fresh layer of cocoa powder on top.
