1. **Maths** - The Maths Worksheet note submissions have officially closed. If you haven’t submitted the worksheet any time for any of the 14 lessons, you will be graded with no marks. If you wish to submit the worksheet note, do so at your own risk. (Mam had to submit the internal marks to Father today. So even if mam grades your worksheet note, it might not be reflected in your internals).

Incomplete submissions of the note will also be graded accordingly. If you have skipped a few sums in a chapter, that’ll also be graded as incomplete.
