1. **General** - Well, we have exams tomorrow. The exam will end between 12:15 PM to 12:30 PM. I am not sure about the duration of school timings, however. Please wait for \*\* official announcement\*\* from school to know whether it’ll be a full day or half day.
2. **Physics** - Final Reminder. Mam will start to correct the records during this examination time… So submit it by tmrw with all the required experiments completed. Remember, this is your _final submission_ of the Record, which will be evaluated for this academic year’s internals.
3. **Biology** - Final Reminder. Mam wants to see the records soon… So submit it by tmrw with all the required experiments completed. Remember, this is your _final submission_ of the Bio Record, which will be evaluated for this academic year’s internals.
4. **Chemistry** - Submit your _Record_ with Experiments 1 and 2 tmrw (as mam had instructed us to submit it by the next working day). And submit your observation notes for all 4 experiments and get them corrected.

The respective contents have changed.” You are requested to start writing the record for Systematic Salts 1 and 2… but there’s a small change in the Systematic Salt 1. You have to prove that Barium doesn’t exist in the Strontium Nitrate compound given, so you have to add a test under the last set of Confirmatory Tests as “1. Potassium Chromate Test”. _**Submission of Record is the next working day, for internals of Periodic Exam 3**_
