1.  **Maths** - The Maths Worksheet note submissions have officially closed. If you haven’t submitted the worksheet any time for any of the 14 lessons, you will be graded with no marks. If you wish to submit the worksheet note, do so at your own risk. (Mam had to submit the internal marks to Father today. So even if mam grades your worksheet note, it might not be reflected in your internals).

    Incomplete submissions of the note will also be graded accordingly. If you have skipped a few sums in a chapter, that’ll also be graded as incomplete.
2. **Physics** - Refer the Physics section of the knowledge hub for Practicals information.

2. **General** - The SOF Level 2 admit cards have been released on SOF’s website. _Please go through the guidelines and download the admit card._
3. **General** - **PUBLIC DISCLOSURE** - I’m kinda sorry for the sending the announcements this late, as my automation had a small bug that crept in while upgrading the automation code, which rendered a dictionary building subsystem completely unusable. _Forgive me._
