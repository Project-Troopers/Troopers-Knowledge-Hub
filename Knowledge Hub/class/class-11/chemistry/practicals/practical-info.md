## Basic Radical Tests (Chlorine - Confirmatory)

The order of adding the compounds is really important.

1. Test for Chlorine - Nitric Acid Test

$$
Salt \; solution + Conc. \; HNO_3 + AgNO_3 \longrightarrow\ White \; ppt \; formation.
$$

1. Test for Chlorine - Evolution of Gas test. **Heat the following reactants in a test tube for the product to form.**

$$
Salt \; solution + MnO_2 + Conc. \; H_2 SO_4 \longrightarrow Cl_2 \; gas \; evolved.
$$

1. **Another Confirmatory Test for Chlorine:** (original text before correction by “ur dad”: Another Test… IDK what’s this for…)

$$
Salt \; Solution + Solid \; K_2 Cr_2 O_7 + Conc. \; H_2 SO_4 \longrightarrow Red \; Vapour + \mathbf{Resultant \; Solution}
$$

Now take the resulting solution and do this reaction.

$$
\mathbf{Resultant} + NaOH + dil. \; CH_3COO + Lead \; Acetate \longrightarrow Yellow \; PPT
$$

## Acid Radical (Calcium)

The order of the tests matter.

1. The Calcium Flame Test - Take some salt on a spatula and burn it. If the flame colour is brick red, it’s probably Calcium
2.  **Group Separation Tests:**

    The tests are in the observation note. However, for the Group 5 test, the order of adding the compounds matter. The correct order is: (not given in note)

$$
Salt \; solution + [NH_4]_2 CO_3 + NH_4 Cl + NH_4 OH \longrightarrow White \; PPT \; formed + \mathbf{Resultant \; Solution}
$$

1. **Confirmatory Test:**

$$
\mathbf{Resultant} + Ammonium \; Orlate \longrightarrow White \; ppt
$$

Thus, the evolution of White ppt confirms the presence of `Ca`.

…for $$CaCl_2$$
