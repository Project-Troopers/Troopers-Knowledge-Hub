# Complex Numbers

## Quick Notes

* Complex Numbers exist to cover the cases that the real number system does not.
* Imaginary numbers are the numbers whose squares are negative real numbers, denoted by i.
* Each complex number is made up of an imaginary and real part. Eg: 3+4i, where 3 is the real part and 4 is the imaginary part. So, Re(z) = 3 and Im(z) = 4.
