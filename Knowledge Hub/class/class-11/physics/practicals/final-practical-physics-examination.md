> #### Notice

> I will neither be held responsible nor accountable for your interpretation of this document. Continue to read at your own risk.

## How will the exam be structured?

The exam will be divided into 3 sections. All questions are mandatory to answer. **Duration:** To be informed (as of now, it seems to be 2 hours)

### Section A

**Experiments:** _(any one of the four might be asked in the exam)_ You are supposed to do the experiment practically and write the Aim, Materials Required, Diagram, Formula, Observations, Conclusion/Results, Sources of Error and any four/six Precautions .

1. Measurement of Diameter of a body using a Vernier Caliper
2. Measurement of Diameter of a wire using a Screw Gauge
3. Effect of length on Time Period of a Simple Pendulum
4. Effect of bobs of different masses on Time Period of a Simple Pendulum

### Section B

**Experiments:** _(any one of the four might be asked in the exam)_ You are supposed to do the experiment practically and write the Aim, Materials Required, Diagram, Formula, Observations, Conclusion/Results, Sources of Error and any four/six Precautions.

1. Concave Mirror
2. Convex Lens
3. Convex Mirror
4. Frequency of AC Mains _(sonometer)_

### Section C - Viva Voce and Record

Towards the end of the exam, you will be asked a few viva questions to gauge your understanding of the concepts, techniques and practicalities of the experiments.

**Must Study:** Theory _(from the practical book),_ Viva Voce Section _(from the practical book),_ Procedures _(from the practical book)_ **Optional, but Recommended:** Related lessons _(from your NCERT Reader for Physics - these are the lessons that I would suggest: Oscillations, Units and Dimensions)_, and if possible, I'd suggest you to read the Class 10 lesson on "_Light_\*\*"\*\*.

**Record:** The record must be neatly covered with a brown sheet, and all the particulars must be filled in. 5 marks will be deduced from your total score if you do not cover the records.

**Examples:-**

*   Why do we use AC current and not DC current in the Sonometer experiment?

    > AC Current will lead to reversal of polarity in the electromagnet, and thus it will lead to the creation of two waves that are similar but move in the opposite direction. This will lead to the superimposition of these waves and leads to the creation of Standing waves.

    > AC current does indeed lead to reversal of polarity in the electromagnet, which can create two waves that move in opposite directions. However, this does not necessarily lead to the creation of standing waves. Standing waves are formed when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude interfere with each other while moving in opposite directions.

    > The use of AC current in the Sonometer experiment is mainly because it allows for easier control and measurement of frequency. By adjusting the frequency of the AC current, the experimenter can find the resonant frequency of the system, which corresponds to the natural frequency of the string on the Sonometer. This is important in studying the physics of vibrations and harmonics on a string.

    > It is worth noting that DC current could also be used in certain cases, such as when studying the behavior of the string under constant tension. However, it is more common to use AC current in the Sonometer experiment due to its advantages in controlling and measuring frequency.
*   Why do we use knife edges in the Sonometer experiment?

    > In the Sonometer experiment, a vibrating wire is used to produce sound waves. The knife edges are used to support the wire and allow it to vibrate freely.

    > The purpose of using knife edges is to accurately measure the length of the wire and to create fixed points where the wire can be adjusted and tensioned. The position of the knife edges helps in determining the fundamental frequency of the wire when it vibrates. By adjusting the position of the knife edges, the effective length of the wire can be changed, and different harmonics can be produced. This allows for the investigation of the relationship between the length of the wire and the frequency of the produced sound.

    > In summary, the purpose of using knife edges in the Sonometer experiment is to support the wire, provide fixed points for adjustment, and accurately measure the length of the wire. They do not act as walls to reflect waves but are essential elements in creating harmonics and investigating the relationship between the length of the wire and the frequency of sound produced.
*   What type of wire is used in the Sonometer experiment? Does it have high or low resistance? Mention its properties.

    > The wire is a gauge wire made from an alloy of steel and other materials with high resistance. This prevents the wire from melting when the waves are of high frequency. It has a density of 7800 $$kg/m^3$$.
