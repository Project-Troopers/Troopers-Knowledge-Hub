## Key Concepts

* Centre of Mass
  * Regular Objects:-
    * Square
    * Rectangle
    * Circle
    * Cylinder
    * Sphere
    * Cube / Cuboid
    * Hemisphere from the base = $$3R/8$$
    * Cone

$$
Located \; at \; (3R/4 , \; 1R/4). \; This \; is \; the \; supposed \; centroid \; of \; cone.
$$

* Generalised formulas

$$
Radius_m \; = \; \frac{\sum mx_i}{\sum m_i}
$$

```
     There are multiple variations of this formula, including the integrated version.
```

* Determining the distance of objects from the COM given.
* Concepts of Density
  * Linear Density
    * $$\frac{Mass}{Length}$$= Linear Density
  * Surface Density
    * $$\frac{Mass}{Area}$$= Surface Density
  * Volume Density I.e. Normal Density
    * $$\frac{Mass}{Volume}$$= Density
* Moment of Inertia
  * Disc, Ring, Sphere, Shell, and Complex figures.
* Rotational Motion
  * Intro to Rotational Quantities
  * Intro to Angular Momentum
  * Determining relationship between Inertia and Angular Velocity through virtue of Conservation of Angular Momentum
  * Intro to Torque, Radius of Gyration
  * Rotational Motion and Rolling Motion
  * Ratio between Total K.E and Rotational K.E.
* Miscellaneous Concepts
