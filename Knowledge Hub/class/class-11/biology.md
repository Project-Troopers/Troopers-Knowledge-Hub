# Biology

Biology is the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. From microscopic bacteria to complex ecosystems, biology encompasses a wide range of topics including genetics, physiology, ecology, and evolution. By understanding the principles and processes that drive life on our planet, biologists strive to uncover the mysteries of life and contribute to advancements in medicine, conservation, and agriculture. Here's our collection of notes for Biology, curated.

> For the Biology record, before you start specimens and spotters (i.e Plant, Animal and Inflorescence), please _LEAVE A PAGE_, and then start writing specimens and spotters.

> Note: If you had already written more than 5 specimens, please do not tear off the pages. Instead, request ma'am to allow you to continue writing in the same format. After obtaining the required permissions, please continue writing.

> Do not write aim procedure etc for inflorescence......... just the specimens and spotters would be enough

11. > Study of Characteristics of Plant Specimens and Identification with Reasons (Refer the rough note image I've sent you, and write down the Classification, Diagnostic Features, Comments and all the Diagrams of each species.)
12. > Study of Characteristics of Animal Specimens and Identification with Reasons (Refer the rough note image I've sent you, and write down the Classification, Diagnostic Features, Comments and the Diagram of each species. Draw all the diagrams present.)

13. > Study and Identification of Different types of Inflorescence \[Take Pg 134, write the "Identification and Comments". Under "Identification and Comments", just write the "Catkin of Mulberry" (with Diagram C for drawing) under Racemose Inflorescence and "Dischasial" (with Diagram B for drawing) for Cymose Inflorescence. Refer the manual images I've sent you.

> ### Cancelled.

> DO NOT WRITE THIS.

14. > Study of Mitosis (Take Pg 128-129 in you manual and write it accordingly. I will clarify with mam about this part... whether to write both experiments, or just one of them. Anyways, you have to write Aim, requirements, Procedure, Observations and Precautions)
15. > Human Skeleton (Will clarify with mam about this later)
