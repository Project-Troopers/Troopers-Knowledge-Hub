# Sentence Reordering

## Tips for Rearranging Sentences

1. Identify the subject and object in a sentence, along with the work they do. These are usually the two nouns present.
2. Adverbs should typically be placed towards the end of a sentence. If you want to emphasise them, only then should they be used at the start.
3. Remember the adjuncts: Manner, Time, Reason, and Place. These can help you rearrange sentences effectively.
4. Match the adjectives with the nouns in a sentence. Adjectives always come before the noun they are describing.
5. Play around with the order of an ordinary sentence. There are many ways you can rearrange it to create different meanings.
6. Quotes and proverbs must be kept in their original order and cannot be changed. If you can't identify them, there's not much you can do.
7. A word that describes the action done is a verb. Make sure to include it in the right place when rearranging sentences.

Remember, when practicing rearranging sentences, you may come across various types such as Conditional Sentences, Gap Filling, and Transformation exercises. Have fun experimenting with different arrangements!

(f) hit/nylons/sold off/were/a spectacular/immediately/and/the shelves/almost

**Answer:**

During World War I, a number of severe shortages alerted the world's scientists to the need for synthetic, or man-made materials. Thus by 1934, a research team headed by Wallace H. Carothers had developed the first synthetic fiber, called nylon. As it turned out, the development of nylon had a surprisingly profound effect on world affairs. True, it's first use was in fashion, and in 1939, the Dupont company began marketing sheer nylon hose for women. Nylons were a spectacular hit and sold off the shelves almost immediately.

But they disappeared with the coming of World War II, as nylon became essential to the war effort. It was used in everything from parachutes and ropes, to insulation and coat linings. Sadly, Carothers never witnessed the impact of his creation. He committed suicide two years before the first pair of nylons ever went on sale.
