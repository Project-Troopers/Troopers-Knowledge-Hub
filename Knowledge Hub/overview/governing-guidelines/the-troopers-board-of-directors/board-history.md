### Consensus #0002: Proposal for Expanding Computer Corps Program Summary

A student, recommended by a friend of Aakash, has expressed interest in joining the exclusive Computer Corps. The current structure limits participation to students from our school.&#x20;

#### Considerations

1. **Inclusivity vs. Exclusivity**: Balancing the program's exclusiveness with potential benefits of inclusivity.&#x20;
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assessing if expansion could strain resources or diminish the quality of the program.&#x20;
3. **Precedent Setting**: Deciding whether this case sets a precedent for future admissions from outside the current internal setup.

#### Recommendations

1. **Expand Internally**: Allow the interested student to join the current Computer Corps, evaluating the impact on the group dynamics and resources.
2. **Create a New Group**: Alternatively, establish a separate computer group for external participants, maintaining the exclusiveness of the original Corps but fostering outreach and inclusivity.

#### Decision Requested

The Board of Directors was kindly asked to deliberate on the mentioned recommendations and make a decision regarding the most suitable approach for the inclusion of the student and potential future external candidates.

#### Discussion

1. **Eric**: Suggested that the person may join the existing group and remaining silent.
2. **Deepan**: Advocated for a separate group, highlighting:
   1. Irrelevance of class-related updates for some members
   2. The possibility of sharing targeted resources
   3. Easier access to study materials for all
   4. Enhanced privacy
3. **Harshavardhan**: Supported the creation a separate group to maintain privacy and relevance for school members.

**Formulated Consensus**: Allow them to participate in the computer science division as a new group.
