      4. **Closure of the Project**: Immediate cessation of all Project Troopers services and removal of associated assets.
6. ### Institutions and their powers
   1. **The Troopers Board of Directors**
      1. The directors are nominees / admins who have been selected by the people or the CIC to lead the Project. They will have control over all the decisions of the Project's administrative matters. These directors will then constitute the Troopers Board of Directors, which has the power to halt, proceed, change, allow or deny any administrative decision before they are put into action. More about the board will be given in this document.
      2. The Board of Directors is the deciding authority of the Project, i.e the _de-facto **head**_. It is where the directors are to propose new ideas, solve conflicts and decide on the future of the Project. This Group will, as is, follow all the rules outlined previously. The directors are in no way above the law. This group will only be composed of the volunteering admins (aka the directors).
      3. Some directors can be considered inactive, if they can not respond to any board activity for 2 weeks or notify the board that they can not attend to the matters of the project temporarily. All other directors will be considered active.
      4. The creation of any sub-group belonging to the Project will also be subject to approval by a majority of the directors and the CIC.
      5. All Board decisions are required to documented well, with transparent proceedings. The board can form its own internal processes, rules and sub-committees. _**The current director(s), with appointed or assigned any roles and their records; the board and its records, and decisions will be maintained under the governing guidelines section of the project.**_
      6. **The Collaborator-in-Charge (CIC):** The CIC is the _de-jure_ head of the Knowledge Hub with level of Ownership, director and a CA-A pass. He has the power to decide upon the administrative matters of the Knowledge Hub, but not without the knowledge and approval of the Board of directors.
      7.  **Proposing ideas or take a decision**

          When a director wants to propose new ideas to the Project's infrastructure or take any decision related to the project, they have to follow a few set of procedures before implementing them, in successive order.

          1. Share the idea with the Board
          2. Allow the whole of the Board to debate upon the idea, including the pros and cons. (Can be skipped if a general consensus is already reached.)
          3. Conduct a poll asking the board members to vote.
          4.  If the idea receives either a:-

              1. 50%+ majority approval by the active directors who have not abstained from voting. All inactive directors are automatically considered "abstained" from voting on the particular idea.
              2. 75% majority by the members of the Troopers Project (in the case when the admins are not available)
              3. super-admin approval through the emergency protocol

              then, it has to be implemented with immediate effect.
          5. Any idea that affects a particular division of the Project and their operations must be discussed with their admins.
          6. After implementation or veto, it has to be recorded below. The Project docs must be also updated in parallel to reflect the same.
      8. No board decision can be implemented without at least three-fourths of the board voicing their opinion regarding it. If the no. of voting directors (i.e non-abstained) fall below the set threshold, then it is mandatory that some directors must change their opinion via a re-vote. If the threshold is still not satisfied after two re-votes or if the no. of inactive directors impedes the voting procedure (during the first vote), then the board is authorised to hold elections to vote directors to the board by the Project Members.
   2. #### Election Committee to conduct Elections to the Board and ArbCom
      1. **Appointment Process:** Members of the community appoint directors or members of the ArbCom through two separate methods, with each member's vote considered equal. The methods are:-
         1. **Normal Procedure:** Each division votes for their representative director or ArbCom member to be seated on the board.
         2. **Special Procedure:** The entire community decides on a director or ArbCom member.
      2. **Authority and Composition:**
         1. Only the Election Committee is authorised to conduct elections for the Board and ArbCom.
         2. The Election Committee comprises members of the Project with a CA-A pass, excluding directors and ArbCom members.
         3. It will not allow existing directors or ArbCom members to run for elections, unless their tenure will expire with the onset of the respective election.
      3. **Rule-Making Authority:**
         1. The Election Committee has the authority to establish its own rules for elections, which will be documented in the Project's Governing Guidelines.
         2. These rules, if aligned with the mission of conducting free and fair elections without unauthorized or malicious activity, are binding on the voters, the ArbCom and the Board.
   3. #### Administrators

         2. Records of current admins and their roles are maintained in the governing guidelines section of the project.
      3. **Removal and Updates:**
         1. Administrators can be removed by a consensus among participants (a majority of 75%), except for the CIC, who can only be removed by the Board and/or ArbCom.
         2. They have the right to update the terms of the agreement except the "Legal Stature" and are granted editing access to the documentation. They can modify group settings, remove members, or resign from their posts.
         3. Admins can transfer their seat or appoint a new admin with Board approval. Outgoing admins may retain editing access with justification and Board approval.
      4. **Accountability and Restrictions:**
         1. Admins are answerable only to the Board and the community, not to other admins.
         2. They are not allowed to single-handedly remove another admin (except during the switch of rolling admins), act on irrational decisions, make major changes to the rules, show prejudice or bias, delete the group, or remove members without proper justification.
   4. #### Arbitration Committee **(ArbCom)**
      1. **Responsibilities:**
         1. The ArbCom ensures proper enforcement of document rules, members' rights, and preservation of the document's basic structure.
         2. It serves as a court of last resort, intervening when other project bodies fail to address issues adequately. However, it can initiate cases even if other avenues haven't been exhausted.
