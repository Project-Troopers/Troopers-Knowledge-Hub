# The Troopers Board of Directors

### Who are we?

We are the top administrative unit of Project Troopers. Our aim is to make the day-to-day decision that are related to the running pf this project.

### Are we too powerful?

In a sense, during the initial days of our existence, we were, and would have been truly powerful to put in place a proper structure to the Project.

However, we are still accountable to the members of the project and, and recently, the ArbCom.

### What gives our authority?

Our legal basis and authority comes from our projectâ€™s [legal stature](https://desktop.craft.do:6776/editor/d/34ae8ebc-d508-7305-20e2-17e06364862c/bebb365f-d340-4b5a-8457-e20b221441b2/x/08EA7FDB-1658-441F-8D60-200B08BF37E2), which can be regarded as the document that provides some base framework to this project.

However, we existed long before the legal stature and the governing guidelines were in force. (Actually, we were the ones who formulated these guidelines themselves.) During those times, it was the immense faith and trust that our project members had in us that helped us to exist and gave us the power to diligently carry out the admin work of Project Troopers.
