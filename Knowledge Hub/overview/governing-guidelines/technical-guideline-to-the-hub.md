# Technical Guideline to the Hub

The Hub and the Project depends on a series of software technologies, handshakes and built-in models. This section is present under the purview of the Legal Stature of the hub.

## GitBook

GitBook is the documentation software on which the hub is located. This page, the website, the sub-domain of hosting, well, most of the software is provided by GitBook. View the required GitBook documentation in the official site linked below, to learn about the editing features.

### GitHub

Since we can't add all the members of the project on GitBook due to technical limitations, we have used GitSync (by GitBook) to sync our documentation with GitHub. It is available at the link listed below. Only members with authorized access roles are allowed to commit to it.
