# Editorial Code of Conduct

## Editorial Code of Conduct

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Info-box

This sub-section of the guidelines serves as a set of rules for the collaborators and users. All templates here can not be modified here, but they can be copied over for use at any other place on the Hub. The templates over here must not be considered as effective in this portion of the guidelines, as they only templates and not an actual notice.

### General Rule of Thumb

While contributing, it is your duty to adhere to the Legal stature and be civil, moral and humane. Any editor can contribute to this page, as long as its part of the built-up consensus by the community.

### Page / block types

A block refers to an element of the Hub. The element may be a paragraph, image, video, file, title… well, you get the idea. A page is a collection of blocks that can be scrolled down and up on your device’s screen.

There are different types of information blocks or block collections available on the Hub.

#### Section

A section refers to a page which has several sub-pages (i.e cards) on the page; or if used in retrospect, can also refer to the content under a particular Heading level.

#### Code 0-8-4

When a code 0-8-4 is invoked on a object, it means that the given object is of unknown origin and must be treated as such. It should be isolated from the rest of the Hub until it is deemed safe. The object may refer to a block or a section or a page, whatever may be applicable. It can be combined with other notices over here.

### Role of Archives

All the content on the hub acts as an archival record in itself. The aim of the hub is to provide content to everyone and ensure that education can be free in itself. This hub is structured in such a way that it helps or supplements the coursework of the students.

All files on the hub must be archived on the Project's Google Drive Implementations, which each collaborator should have varying access to.

### What are stubs?

Stubs are sections of the hub that are considered incomplete and require further elaboration. The stub notices serve as a reminder to collaborators that additional information is needed to make the section more helpful to viewers. If you have the knowledge and expertise, feel free to contribute to expanding these stub sections.

## Templates and actions

### Access levels

#### The CA-A pass

The CA-A pass (stylised as ::📣 CA-A:: ) allow the contributor to edit all Class Action Sections and Notice Box contents of the Knowledge Hub. The person with the CA-A pass would automatically be considered an admin, with limited control over project matters.

### Priority Levels

#### Class Action

A class action notice is something that conveys messages or information of varying importance. It is secured with varying levels of protection. It can not be removed by everyone. Only people with permitted access levels can edit it, or delete it. However, when a Maintenance Notice has been placed above the CA notice by the people with the same access levels as the CA notice, it ceases to be effective until the notice is removed. It is applicable to a group of blocks or the entire section:-

* **Notice Box** - It conveys an important message related to that section, but does not protect all the blocks that follow. Rather, it only protects the message inside the Notice Box. (Group of Blocks)
* **Section** - It means that the entire section and its derivative sub-sections, unless otherwise mentioned, is completely protected with a class action notice.

The types are:-

* **Type A (of CA)**

**Badge**: 📣 CA-A **Protection**: High **Severity**: Detrimental

A “Type A” notice is a message that conveys something extremely important. It is considered detrimental to the functioning of the Hub. It is protected with a CA-A empirical pass. No contributor is allowed to modify the CA-A protected content, except the people with a CA-A pass.

Every CA-A invoked section must have a CA-A notice on the main page of the section, preferably at the top. The colour of a CA-A notice is supposed to be red; in standalone version. However, if a CA-A notice is serving another purpose, then it can be indicated with another colour. The template for the CA-A notices is as follows: (Replace all tags in `code blocks (or monospaced)` as instructed inside them.)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAIS-A (Class Action Information Section, Type - A)** Notice

This is a ::Class Action Information Section, Type A::. All information in this section and its sub-sections are to be taken with utmost severity; and is highly protected. Only members with a ::📣 CA-A:: pass are allowed to edit this section. All details enforced within is/are serious matter(s). ([Learn why.](editorial-code-of-conduct.md#class-action))

_CAIS-A notice placed by **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date)`; unless otherwise cancelled._
{% endhint %}

The above notice is a CAIS-A template; the upcoming notice is a CANB-A template.

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### `Any Title`

This is a `Class Action Notice Box, Type A (CANB-A)`. Do not remove this Notice box, if you don’t have the required access level. [(Learn why.)](editorial-code-of-conduct.md#class-action)

`Add your message here in the "Body" style.`

by _\*\*\*_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(\*\*\*`member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_(`date);` unless otherwise cancelled.
{% endhint %}

* Type B (of CA) - has not been ratified yet.
* Type C

### Maintenance Notices

A maintenance notice serves to inform users that a specific area of the hub is currently undergoing development or maintenance. This notice can pertain to a sub-section, section, page, or other designated areas. When a maintenance notice is displayed, it supersedes any other notice or content placed below it, whether it involves a collection of headings or is positioned within the affected area, such as a particular heading. Yellow is the customary colour for a maintenance notice, and it can be merged with priority levels, but no other elements.

* The effectiveness of a priority level is contingent upon its placement within the notice box.
* If a priority level is situated either underneath the notice box, specifically in reference to a particular page or section, or within the affected area, such as a specific heading, it renders the priority level ineffective and voided immediately.

To communicate this information, it will be relayed through the maintenance notice or tag. The template for the notice is provided below, where the necessary details should be inserted, replacing the code blocks or monospaced font:

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### 🧑‍🔧 This `section` is under Maintenance!

We’ve currently polishing up a few things, and tightening up a few bolts to ensure that this section provides the best quality info possible. However, until then, this part may feel janky or contain invalid information. It’s safe to ignore this part until `this notice is removed`.

**Affected Areas:** `use when applicable`

Thank you for your patience, cooperation and understanding!

### Unreliable Content

The integrity of information posted on the Knowledge Hub is of utmost importance. Whilst we strive to ensure that all content shared is reliable and accurate, there may be instances where it becomes necessary to include content that may be deemed unreliable or inaccurate. In such instances, the respective section will be preceded by a Content notice, clearly indicating any discrepancies. It is essential to note that the Knowledge Hub cannot be held responsible for any personal interpretations made based on the content provided.

The template for the notice is:-

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Questionable Content**

The following section contains content of questionable accuracy from questionable sources. We expect you to take the given section with a pinch of salt… We will not be held responsible nor accountable for your interpretation of the given content. [(Learn why you’re seeing this.)](editorial-code-of-conduct.md#unreliable-content)

by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date).`
{% endhint %}

### Sensitive Content

> <mark style="color:green;">“It is important to be sensible about sensitive information.”</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">- Carmel Jeru Joachim</mark>

In situations where content is identified as potentially harmful, sensitive, or related to ongoing events, it is important to acknowledge that the information provided on the Hub may be outdated or unreliable; and that we might not know everything. To ensure user awareness, we will display a notice above such content. However, it is crucial to note that the interpretation and understanding of the content remains solely the responsibility of the user, and the Hub cannot be held accountable for any user interpretations.

The template is:-

{% hint style="warning" %}
**⚠️ Caution: Outdated or Potentially Harmful Information**

This section may contain sensitive or harmful information related to ongoing events. Please note that the content may be outdated or superseded by new information. We advise you to exercise caution when referring to this section, as we are not liable for your interpretation or understanding of the content.[ (Learn why you’re seeing this.)](editorial-code-of-conduct.md#sensitive-content)

{% endhint %}

### Information Notice

The Information Notice is a useful tool for effectively communicating important information to users. This template is specifically designed to provide users with pertinent details and updates regarding various matters. It should be noted that this notice should only be utilised when there are no other existing templates that serve a similar purpose. By using the Information Notice, users can stay informed and up to date on critical information that may impact them.

The template for this notice is:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Infobox**

`Content`

by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date).`
{% endhint %}

### Opinions section

Some sections contain a person or a group of people’s collective opinion on a particular topic. Though the content would usually be something useful, it’s always better to take the opinions with a pinch of salt. People have different opinions, so it’s ok to agree to disagree. Opinions are never factually accurate, so don’t take them to be gospel truth.

The template for this notice is:-

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Opinions coming right up! 🎤

This section contains opinions of the author(s), who have written out this piece of content. Your views may differ, and it’s always ok to agree to disagree. Never expect this information to be factually accurate, and the Hub will not take any responsibility for the views enclosed within, nor your interpretation of it.

### Stubs

This notice is created when a particular section of the hub is regarded as a stub and requires elaboration.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Stub Notice

This section of the hub needs a lot more information than just this, to prove helpful to the viewer. If you're a collaborator and if you have enough knowledge, then please do elaborate this section so that it will prove helpful.
