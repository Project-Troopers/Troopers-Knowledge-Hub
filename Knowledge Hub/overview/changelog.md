### 22-11-2023

1. The speaker is discontinuing (sunsetting) the current "Psychology" group of the Troopers Project because there is already another Psychology group consisting of all Psychology students in Class 11. The speaker wants to respect the independence of this alternate group. However, if the alternate Psychology group wants to join the Troopers project, they are welcome to do so.

> Once again, an invitation is being extended to all individuals who possess materials or have an interest in contributing to the Troopers Hub. It is requested that volunteers actively maintain various sections such as "Psychology", "Computer Science", "Announcements", and "Homework", among others. Contributions ranging from graphic designing, physical drawings, materials, videos, and software-related skills (like API versioning, endpoints, etc) will be highly appreciated. A poll will be posted to gauge interest and availability.

After a small problem involving an non-participating party, the description of the Troopers Group was changed to provide more clarity on the function of the group as a whole. The verdict of an admin has been attached above (may contain personal info).
