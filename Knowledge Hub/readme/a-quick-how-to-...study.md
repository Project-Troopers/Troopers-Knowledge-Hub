## The Best Tips to cover a chapter

1. **Listen to your classes properly.** The most effective way to learn 80% of the concept is by listening properly in class or a lecture. Make proper notes that you understand so that you can go through them when you have the time.
2. **Go through your main reference material thoroughly**. Usually, the lecturer would give you a good idea or understanding of the concept. However, humans do make mistakes, and it‚Äôs best to go through your main reference material (e.g. NCERT) for factually accurate information.
3. **Even the main reference material may contain mistakes.** So, refer other books and internet sources. Watch videos and read through library books. Or better, choose an updated single source to always refer as an alternative.
4. **Keep your notes up to date.** Your notes are your last resort to help you go through the lessons properly. So, maintain them properly, and never lose them. They should have the latest information, and a small sample collection of sums and questions at one place. It can be both digital or physical. Use it wisely.
5. **Practice regularly.** The only way to improve your understanding of a concept, whether it is from biology or from chemistry, you must practice. Do a lot of sums, and do them regularly. Keep a repository of important sums for quick reference.
6. **Revise regularly.** "I do not fear the man who knows 1000 techniques. I fear the man who has practiced the same technique a 1000 times." Therefore, revise regularly. Do the same questions over and over again, to get a good grip on the concept.
7. **Help others to learn the concept.** The best way to solidify a concept is to teach it others. This will help you to recall the same thing, and you can become even clear in your conceptual understanding.
8. **Pareto's Principle.** The famous "80-20" principle can also be applied in studies. About 80% of the questions come from just 20% of the concept. So, note down the important topics and practice them regularly.

## Tips to study better

1. **Create a study space.** A study space can go a long way in making you better at something. A familiar environment helps you to kick into the grove faster and study better. It should ideally be a simple spacious place with a table, a chair and no distractions included.
2. **Identity Switching.** Instead of thinking that it is impossible to complete a subject within a given time frame; switch your personality for that particular moment.
3. **Nothing is impossible.** I know, it's easier said than done. But the reward and the satisfying feeling you get when you've achieve something that you've considered impossible‚Ä¶ well nothing beats that, if you ask me.
4. **Study in slots.** Nothing can be easily achieved in one go. If you're working to improve your long-term studying skills and your retention capabilities, then study in slots. 1 hour or 2 hours or 3 hours, do what best suits you. Pomodoro techniques can also help.
5. **Have an accountability buddy to help you.** The best way to get back into the groove to study is to have an accountability buddy. Someone whom you can trust to keep some sort of checks and balances on you. It's very hard to find one today, but trust me, if you find one, you're very lucky. Like extremely rarely lucky.
6. **Build a network.** If your friends don't value the fact that you study well, you'll stop doing that in some time. Instead, find connections and meet with people who value you, your skill and knowledge. Share, learn and grow together.
