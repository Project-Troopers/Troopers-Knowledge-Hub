## About us.

We are the under runners, the administrators, the people who used to build this hub and keep it in place. It was our vision and our expertise that expanded across multiple classes to make Project Troopers what it is today.

We are a team dedicated to providing a seamless and efficient platform for students to manage their homework assignments and stay updated on important announcements. Our goal is to help students stay organized, prioritize tasks, and succeed academically. With our expertise and commitment, we strive to make homework management a breeze for all students. Thank you for being part of The First Brigadier Regiment, and let's work together to achieve academic excellence!

We predate the hub in its existence. It was one of our internal discussions that helped us to create the hub today.

### About our teachers

#### More about our English Teacher.

Ms. Carmel Jeru Joachim is an ardent and resilient English teacher who’s had 20+ years of teaching experience. Born and raised in Chennai, she’s worked tirelessly to become the teacher she is today.

She passionately studied at a teacher training school around the age of 18, which rigorously trained her in discipline, time management and composure. During this time, the soft and timid girl blossomed into the beautiful and vibrant teacher that stands as a beacon of hope for students today.

She has navigated a significant transition, evolving from a primarily written English focus to a broader spoken English perspective. This shift has unlocked numerous opportunities for her, and she has simultaneously completed her postgraduate studies.

She uses life experience, example and deep relations to analyse and tie her lesson plans together, giving the students the knowledge they need to score well in English. She strongly believes that,

> It’s very easy to pass in English, but it's very hard to score good marks in English.\
> \- Carmel Jeru Joachim

Her transparent methods, insights and tips that she provides her students are keys to unlocking the intricacies behind the language and achieve an exuberant level of language skills, whether it’s speaking, writing or listening.

She’s ready to even swoop down to the very basic level and teach from scratch, when needed. And, she never, ever, compromises on Ethics.

She’s married to Mani, and they’ve been blessed with two daughters. She and her younger daughter took care of a young hurt squirrel during lockdown and released it later into the wild later; revealing their compassionate hearts and love for nature.

Some of her past pupils still remain in touch with her, and one of them wishes her happy birthday every year! That’s the result of her continuing success as a great educator in today’s turbulent times.
