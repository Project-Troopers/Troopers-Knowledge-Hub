## Timeline

1. The Issue work commenced on March 10, 2024.
2. The main theme was accepted by the same day.
3. The overall general plan for this edition was formed by Friday March 15.

## General Plan

Ok so to consolidate all the suggestions that we have received up to now:-

* We might be using Canva or Powerpoint to design our next newsletter. Neysa and Faheema would be Chief Designers.

[Free Google Slides themes and Powerpoint templates | Slidesgo](https://slidesgo.com/)

* The title of the newsletter “The Corridor” will be located on separate horizontal strip, not on the A4 sheet pages.
* ⁠The theme will be Women’s history month or Women’s day. (The associated movie highlight may be “Damsel” or “Barbie”, though this part was later dropped off.)
* ⁠The newsletter will consists of six A4 sheet pages (which will be trimmed down to fit the 16:9 ratio) and a vertical separate strip.
* First Page - Logical Reasoning Page (A logical reasoning question is posed in the first page). Done by Nikhel Joseph.
* Second Page - "Voices of The Letter" (One of the members take turns every issue to publish a write-up that is either relevant to the topic or friendly, inoffensive banter with the reader). This week, the article is by Riya Roopesh on the topic of Women Empowerment.
* The third and fourth pages of the document will feature trivia questions in a "Guess the... with the given clues" format. The third page will focus on prominent women, while the fourth page will highlight women empowerment movies.
* Fifth Page (Origami) - Dinosaur by Faheema Nasrin.
* The sixth page will consist of a crossword by Ishana Santhosh related to women \_\_\_\_. (I would suggest more of something related to law… just so that it may spark interest in some CLAT aspirants.)
* The last vertical strip should either contain a homegrown comic or a kind of place where students can stick some sticky notes related to their aspirations or suggestions for others (including improvements to the corridor).
* The colours of the upcoming edition should be bright and vibrant. There should be some form of colour (tone) variation between the slides, while still maintaining the overall theme.

Afterthoughts:-

This time it's a puzzle named "Connections", the idea of which is directly taken by the puzzles posted by Wyna Liu for the New York Times daily.

This time, it's an article by Riya Roopesh on the theme of this week's newsletter and it comes under the "Voices of Our Team" section, where each member of our team takes turn on rotation to submit a write-up.

    **Can you guess the movie correctly?**

    _Boston Strangler (2023)_

    > **Loretta McLaughlin**: What do these three women have in common? Three shadowy patterns of attack. Three knotted loops that bind them together. Strangers to one another in life, they became sisters in death. Each coming to the same horror-filled moment of murder by strangulation by a killer who came quietly, who is careful in his derangement, and self-possessed enough to lock the door on his way out.

    **Article on Women Empowerment**

    Gender equality is like the ultimate boss level of human rights - everyone deserves a fair shot, right? But throughout history, it's been a bit like a never-ending game where women had to fight for a seat at the table. From ancient times to modern days, ladies have had to roll up their sleeves and demand equality. They've been shouting from rooftops for a level playing field and have been acing the game of empowerment ever since. Pumping up their political, social, economic, and health muscles has become the ultimate quest.

    In many corners of the globe, ladies often get the short end of the stick when it comes to education. Their talents and intelligence are sometimes shrugged off, and the power scales are tipped against them, from their homes to the world stage.

    It's high time to even out the playing field. Let's crack open the doors to education for all and give props where they're due. When women are bossing the decision-making tables, standing up for their rights, and rocking every sector, that's when the magic happens. Societies bloom, progress booms, and the future starts looking brighter. Let's team up, smash stereotypes, and pave the way to a world where gender equality isn't just a dream but a reality for all.

**STILL I RISE**

_\~Maya Angelou_

You may write me down in history

With your bitter, twisted lies,

You may trod me in the very dirt

But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?

Why are you beset with gloom?

’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,

With the certainty of tides,

Just like hopes springing high,

Still I'll rise.
