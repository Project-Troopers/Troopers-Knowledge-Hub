Welcome to the alternate management system page for the Hub, designed only for the administrators to see. This is where the actual content of the hub lies.

### Trooper Internal Pages

**Hello, fellow Trooper!**

Welcome to Project Troopers! I’m Sugeeth, the Collaborator In-Charge (i.e the **de-jure** head) of this Project Troopers.

### What is Project Troopers?

Well, in the simplest form, Project Troopers is an educational initiative started by me, to help all students who are a part of it to solve their doubts, access learning materials easily and allow them to share their understanding (i.e create their own materials) with everyone.

This is our second year of operations, which was sanctioned and approved by the majority of all troopers who were in group.

This Project was quite small towards the start, with only including my classmates. Pretty soon, we inducted Jugzards and expanded our outreach to the entire senior secondary part of my school. We're on the process of onboarding others too.

The current outreach operation is aimed at connecting students everywhere. You guys, are now part of our pan-India outreach programme (which is still very small)… but we aim to expand soon.

We are a non-profit non-governmental organisation, a student body for the students, by the students and of the students. We are not linked with any school, any institution. And our structure is pretty military-themed, so don't mind if we use a lot of military related terms.

### Our Initiatives and Structure

1.  #### The Doubt Groups

    The group which you guys are part of, are the communication groups where we, at Project Troopers, connect to every student who wishes to participate, access and view project Materials. Anyone can express their views, opinions and doubts, while being civil, moral and humane.

    These groups are created with certain interest groups in mind, called "Regiments", which cater to specific audience groups. We also have some "corps" too, which cater to specific subjects under the regiments.

    All regiments and related corps are banded together under a division. For example: "The First Brigadier Regiment", "The Second Brigadier Regiment" and 'The Fourth Brigadier Regiment"; along with "The Biology Corps", "The Computer Corps" are banded under the "The Common Brigadier Regimental Division".

    Each division related to a particular batch…. For eg: Brigadiers refer to the batch which is studied Class 10 in the academic year 2022-2023, Class 11 in the academic year 2024-2025, and studying class 12 in the academic year 2024-2025.

    Now, each group has its own set of admins. And each division will provide us with a director…

    **The Board of Directors**

    This project was originally run by a core group. Since we expanded, we needed only a few trust-worthy people to take decisions, on behalf of the people on the Project. So, we have a Board of Directors, the highest administrative authority of the project that is allowed to take decisions. The board is headed by the Collaborator In-Charge (that's me), who will be appointed by the Board. Each decision taken by the board goes through a vote.

    Since the whole hub is just transitioning into this structure, I, the CIC will do some heavy-lifting and will take care of some administrative decision on my own… After some time, when the board has decided to implement the governing guidelines and related structures, I will have very limited power…
2.  #### The Troopers Knowledge Hub

    It is our repository of information, here we share our files and knowledge. It is available at trooopers.craft.me and is run by a group of volunteers, called collaborators. If you wish to contribute to the hub, let us know.

[Troopers Knowledge Hub: Unleash Your Potential](https://troopers.craft.me/)

The Hub does contain some materials that the contributors create and some materials from other sources. We release the material that we created under the Creative Commons 4.0 Share-Alike License.

3.  #### Jugzards

    It is the place where we archive our materials that we have on the hub. It is also maintained by a group of collaborators…

If you have any doubts, please ask us, and we will help you. Thank you for joining Project Troopers!

**The Regimental Subsidiaries**

In this section of the Troopers Knowledge Hub, we will explore the various Regimental Subsidiaries that make up our esteemed organisation. From specialised units to support divisions, these subsidiaries play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of our regiment. Join us as we delve into the unique roles and responsibilities of each subsidiary and gain a deeper understanding of their contributions to our mission success.

### The Brigadier Division

**The Brigadier Common Division**

Welcome to the section dedicated to all the common materials used by the Brigadiers and the subunits within the Troopers' Brigadier Division, known as regiments. In this section, you will find information on the essential equipment, tools, and resources that are utilized by our troops in their daily operations and missions. Explore our comprehensive guide to the materials that help our Troopers stay prepared, efficient, and effective in their duties.

### Who are we?

We are a select group of Class 12 students who make up a focus group. Our division is exclusive, reserved only for invite-only affairs within our group. We come together to provide valuable insights, feedback, and perspectives on various topics to help drive positive change and growth within our community. Together, we strive to make a difference and make our voices heard.

### Series 2

> **Leader**: Ishana Santhosh. **Chief Designers**: Faheema Nasrin and Neysa Kristyn Ebinezer

#### Ongoing Issue Work

**Issue 1**

> Status: Almost done. ::Theme: Women’s Day:: Published on \_\_\_\_

> > ### Final Version

[The Corridor - Series 2 Issue 1 - Final Work.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f6t25ptsKeradj6pUEFq7xxBeCAVBOZd/view?usp=drive\_link)

### Timeline

1. The Issue work commenced on March 10, 2024.
2. The main theme was accepted by the same day.
3. The overall general plan for this edition was formed by Friday March 15.

### General Plan

Ok so to consolidate all the suggestions that we have received up to now:-

* We might be using Canva or Powerpoint to design our next newsletter. Neysa and Faheema would be Chief Designers.

[Free Google Slides themes and Powerpoint templates | Slidesgo](https://slidesgo.com/)

* The title of the newsletter “The Corridor” will be located on separate horizontal strip, not on the A4 sheet pages.
* ⁠The theme will be Women’s history month or Women’s day. (The associated movie highlight may be “Damsel” or “Barbie”, though this part was later dropped off.)
* ⁠The newsletter will consists of six A4 sheet pages (which will be trimmed down to fit the 16:9 ratio) and a vertical separate strip.
* First Page - Logical Reasoning Page (A logical reasoning question is posed in the first page). Done by Nikhel Joseph.
* Second Page - "Voices of The Letter" (One of the members take turns every issue to publish a write-up that is either relevant to the topic or friendly, inoffensive banter with the reader). This week, the article is by Riya Roopesh on the topic of Women Empowerment.
* The third and fourth pages of the document will feature trivia questions in a "Guess the... with the given clues" format. The third page will focus on prominent women, while the fourth page will highlight women empowerment movies.
* Fifth Page (Origami) - Dinosaur by Faheema Nasrin.
* The sixth page will consist of a crossword by Ishana Santhosh related to women \_\_\_\_. (I would suggest more of something related to law… just so that it may spark interest in some CLAT aspirants.)
* The last vertical strip should either contain a homegrown comic or a kind of place where students can stick some sticky notes related to their aspirations or suggestions for others (including improvements to the corridor).
* The colours of the upcoming edition should be bright and vibrant. There should be some form of colour (tone) variation between the slides, while still maintaining the overall theme.

Afterthoughts:-

This time it's a puzzle named "Connections", the idea of which is directly taken by the puzzles posted by Wyna Liu for the New York Times daily.

This time, it's an article by Riya Roopesh on the theme of this week's newsletter and it comes under the "Voices of Our Team" section, where each member of our team takes turn on rotation to submit a write-up.

    **Can you guess the movie correctly?**

    _Boston Strangler (2023)_

    > **Loretta McLaughlin**: What do these three women have in common? Three shadowy patterns of attack. Three knotted loops that bind them together. Strangers to one another in life, they became sisters in death. Each coming to the same horror-filled moment of murder by strangulation by a killer who came quietly, who is careful in his derangement, and self-possessed enough to lock the door on his way out.

    **Article on Women Empowerment**

    Gender equality is like the ultimate boss level of human rights - everyone deserves a fair shot, right? But throughout history, it's been a bit like a never-ending game where women had to fight for a seat at the table. From ancient times to modern days, ladies have had to roll up their sleeves and demand equality. They've been shouting from rooftops for a level playing field and have been acing the game of empowerment ever since. Pumping up their political, social, economic, and health muscles has become the ultimate quest.

    In many corners of the globe, ladies often get the short end of the stick when it comes to education. Their talents and intelligence are sometimes shrugged off, and the power scales are tipped against them, from their homes to the world stage.

    It's high time to even out the playing field. Let's crack open the doors to education for all and give props where they're due. When women are bossing the decision-making tables, standing up for their rights, and rocking every sector, that's when the magic happens. Societies bloom, progress booms, and the future starts looking brighter. Let's team up, smash stereotypes, and pave the way to a world where gender equality isn't just a dream but a reality for all.

**STILL I RISE**

_\~Maya Angelou_

You may write me down in history

With your bitter, twisted lies,

You may trod me in the very dirt

But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?

Why are you beset with gloom?

’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,

With the certainty of tides,

Just like hopes springing high,

Still I'll rise.

## Exploring Craters on the Moon

### Materials

* Large baking pan or shallow cardboard box
* Flour (enough to fill the pan)
* Cocoa powder (enough to create a thin layer on top of the flour)
* Sieve or sifter
* Balls of various sizes
* Optional: ruler and meter stick

### Instructions

1. Fill the baking pan with flour.

![Image.jpg](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/9bj9A2g-saAn3ag63rz7qroQgnw=/550x276/-/https/www.sciencebuddies.org/cdn/Files/13096/4/baking-pan-flour.jpg)

2. Use the sieve to put a thin layer of cocoa powder on top of the flour.
3. Try dropping a ball into the pan from about half a meter above it (optionally, use the meter stick so you can drop from a consistent height).
4. Look at the resulting impact crater. What color is the surface immediately around the crater? How does that compare to the surface of the rest of the pan? How far did the flour and cocoa powder spread? Optionally, use the ruler to measure these distances.

![Image.jpg](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/WOPhiLTaGjEAkv2uHz0JuIB72uY=/550x309/-/https/www.sciencebuddies.org/cdn/Files/13097/4/ruler-measure-crater.jpg)

5. Try dropping the same ball from a different height. What does the resulting crater look like?
6. Try dropping balls of different sizes from the same height, and examine the resulting craters.
7. You can even try throwing a ball sideways so it hits the pan at an angle, instead of coming straight down. How is the resulting impact pattern different from when you dropped the balls straight down?
8. If needed, smooth out the surface of the pan, and sift a fresh layer of cocoa powder on top.

      4. **Closure of the Project**: Immediate cessation of all Project Troopers services and removal of associated assets.
4. ## Institutions and their powers
   1. #### The Troopers Board of Directors
      1. The directors are nominees / admins who have been selected by the people or the CIC to lead the Project. They will have control over all the decisions of the Project's administrative matters. These directors will then constitute the Troopers Board of Directors, which has the power to halt, proceed, change, allow or deny any administrative decision before they are put into action. More about the board will be given in this document.
      2. The Board of Directors is the deciding authority of the Project, i.e the _de-facto **head**_. It is where the directors are to propose new ideas, solve conflicts and decide on the future of the Project. This Group will, as is, follow all the rules outlined previously. The directors are in no way above the law. This group will only be composed of the volunteering admins (aka the directors).
      3. Some directors can be considered inactive, if they can not respond to any board activity for 2 weeks or notify the board that they can not attend to the matters of the project temporarily. All other directors will be considered active.
      4. The creation of any sub-group belonging to the Project will also be subject to approval by a majority of the directors and the CIC.
      5. All Board decisions are required to documented well, with transparent proceedings. The board can form its own internal processes, rules and sub-committees. _**The current director(s), with appointed or assigned any roles and their records; the board and its records, and decisions will be maintained under the governing guidelines section of the project.**_
      6. **The Collaborator-in-Charge (CIC):** The CIC is the _de-jure_ head of the Knowledge Hub with level of Ownership, director and a CA-A pass. He has the power to decide upon the administrative matters of the Knowledge Hub, but not without the knowledge and approval of the Board of directors.
      7.  #### Proposing ideas or take a decision

          When a director wants to propose new ideas to the Project's infrastructure or take any decision related to the project, they have to follow a few set of procedures before implementing them, in successive order.

          1. Share the idea with the Board
          2. Allow the whole of the Board to debate upon the idea, including the pros and cons. (Can be skipped if a general consensus is already reached.)
          3. Conduct a poll asking the board members to vote.
          4.  If the idea receives either a:-

              1. 50%+ majority approval by the active directors who have not abstained from voting. All inactive directors are automatically considered "abstained" from voting on the particular idea.
              2. 75% majority by the members of the Troopers Project (in the case when the admins are not available)
              3. super-admin approval through the emergency protocol

              then, it has to be implemented with immediate effect.
          5. Any idea that affects a particular division of the Project and their operations must be discussed with their admins.
          6. After implementation or veto, it has to be recorded below. The Project docs must be also updated in parallel to reflect the same.
      8. No board decision can be implemented without at least three-fourths of the board voicing their opinion regarding it. If the no. of voting directors (i.e non-abstained) fall below the set threshold, then it is mandatory that some directors must change their opinion via a re-vote. If the threshold is still not satisfied after two re-votes or if the no. of inactive directors impedes the voting procedure (during the first vote), then the board is authorised to hold elections to vote directors to the board by the Project Members.
   2. ### Election Committee to conduct Elections to the Board and ArbCom
      1. **Appointment Process:** Members of the community appoint directors or members of the ArbCom through two separate methods, with each member's vote considered equal. The methods are:-
         1. **Normal Procedure:** Each division votes for their representative director or ArbCom member to be seated on the board.
         2. **Special Procedure:** The entire community decides on a director or ArbCom member.
      2. **Authority and Composition:**
         1. Only the Election Committee is authorised to conduct elections for the Board and ArbCom.
         2. The Election Committee comprises members of the Project with a CA-A pass, excluding directors and ArbCom members.
         3. It will not allow existing directors or ArbCom members to run for elections, unless their tenure will expire with the onset of the respective election.
      3. **Rule-Making Authority:**
         1. The Election Committee has the authority to establish its own rules for elections, which will be documented in the Project's Governing Guidelines.
         2. These rules, if aligned with the mission of conducting free and fair elections without unauthorized or malicious activity, are binding on the voters, the ArbCom and the Board.
   3. ### Administrators
      1. **Accountability and Enforcement:** The CIC, the Board, and the admins are accountable to the rules outlined in this document. They have the authority to punish participants found violating any rules and regulations.
      2. **Appointment and Responsibilities:**
         1. Administrators are appointed based on the needs of the project and have limited roles or sections to oversee. They are responsible for handling violations within their jurisdiction, filing reports, and providing reasoning for their judgments.
         2. Records of current admins and their roles are maintained in the governing guidelines section of the project.
      3. **Removal and Updates:**
         1. Administrators can be removed by a consensus among participants (a majority of 75%), except for the CIC, who can only be removed by the Board and/or ArbCom.
         2. They have the right to update the terms of the agreement except the "Legal Stature" and are granted editing access to the documentation. They can modify group settings, remove members, or resign from their posts.
         3. Admins can transfer their seat or appoint a new admin with Board approval. Outgoing admins may retain editing access with justification and Board approval.
      4. **Accountability and Restrictions:**
         1. Admins are answerable only to the Board and the community, not to other admins.
         2. They are not allowed to single-handedly remove another admin (except during the switch of rolling admins), act on irrational decisions, make major changes to the rules, show prejudice or bias, delete the group, or remove members without proper justification.
   4. ### Arbitration Committee **(ArbCom)**
      1. **Responsibilities:**
         1. The ArbCom ensures proper enforcement of document rules, members' rights, and preservation of the document's basic structure.
         2. It serves as a court of last resort, intervening when other project bodies fail to address issues adequately. However, it can initiate cases even if other avenues haven't been exhausted.
      2. **Formation and Tenure:**
         1. The ArbCom panel is independently appointed by project members through consensus member voting and receives responsibilities from the community.
         2. Each ArbCom member serves a 3-month tenure, with 1/3 of the panel replaced by new members at a time.
         3. No ArbCom member can be allowed to be a director and vice versa.
      3. **Powers:**
         1. ArbCom has the authority to challenge decisions or policies by project members, the Board, or the CIC, as long as they don't alter the project's fundamental principles.
         2. They can make administrative decisions in the form of Case judgments, acting with complete administrative authority, if it is related and pertinent with respect to the case.
         3. ArbCom operates independently to ensure project integrity and may only be disbanded by its own decision.

**Editorial Code of Conduct**

> ### Info-box

> This sub-section of the guidelines serves as a set of rules for the collaborators and users. All templates here can not be modified here, but they can be copied over for use at any other place on the Hub. The templates over here must not be considered as effective in this portion of the guidelines, as they only templates and not an actual notice.

### General Rule of Thumb

While contributing, it is your duty to adhere to the Legal stature and be civil, moral and humane. Any editor can contribute to this page, as long as its part of the built-up consensus by the community.

### Page / block types

A block refers to an element of the Hub. The element may be a paragraph, image, video, file, title… well, you get the idea. A page is a collection of blocks that can be scrolled down and up on your device’s screen.

There are different types of information blocks or block collections available on the Hub.

#### Section

A section refers to a page which has several sub-pages (i.e cards) on the page; or if used in retrospect, can also refer to the content under a particular Heading level.

#### Code 0-8-4

When a code 0-8-4 is invoked on a object, it means that the given object is of unknown origin and must be treated as such. It should be isolated from the rest of the Hub until it is deemed safe. The object may refer to a block or a section or a page, whatever may be applicable. It can be combined with other notices over here.

### Role of Archives

All the content on the hub acts as an archival record in itself. The aim of the hub is to provide content to everyone and ensure that education can be free in itself. This hub is structured in such a way that it helps or supplements the coursework of the students.

All files on the hub must be archived on the Project's Google Drive Implementations, which each collaborator should have varying access to.

### What are stubs?

Stubs are sections of the hub that are considered incomplete and require further elaboration. The stub notices serve as a reminder to collaborators that additional information is needed to make the section more helpful to viewers. If you have the knowledge and expertise, feel free to contribute to expanding these stub sections.

## Templates and actions

### Access levels

#### The CA-A pass

The CA-A pass (stylised as ::📣 CA-A:: ) allow the contributor to edit all Class Action Sections and Notice Box contents of the Knowledge Hub. The person with the CA-A pass would automatically be considered an admin, with limited control over project matters.

### Priority Levels

#### Class Action

A class action notice is something that conveys messages or information of varying importance. It is secured with varying levels of protection. It can not be removed by everyone. Only people with permitted access levels can edit it, or delete it. However, when a Maintenance Notice has been placed above the CA notice by the people with the same access levels as the CA notice, it ceases to be effective until the notice is removed. It is applicable to a group of blocks or the entire section:-

* **Notice Box** - It conveys an important message related to that section, but does not protect all the blocks that follow. Rather, it only protects the message inside the Notice Box. (Group of Blocks)
* **Section** - It means that the entire section and its derivative sub-sections, unless otherwise mentioned, is completely protected with a class action notice.

The types are:-

* **Type A (of CA)**

**Badge**: ::📣 CA-A:: **Protection**: High **Severity**: Detrimental

A “Type A” notice is a message that conveys something extremely important. It is considered detrimental to the functioning of the Hub. It is protected with a CA-A empirical pass. No contributor is allowed to modify the CA-A protected content, except the people with a ::CA-A pass:: .

Every CA-A invoked section must have a CA-A notice on the main page of the section, preferably at the top. The colour of a CA-A notice is supposed to be red; in standalone version. However, if a CA-A notice is serving another purpose, then it can be indicated with another colour. The template for the CA-A notices is as follows: (Replace all tags in `code blocks (or monospaced)` as instructed inside them.)

> ### **CAIS-A (Class Action Information Section, Type - A)** Notice

> This is a ::Class Action Information Section, Type A::. All information in this section and its sub-sections are to be taken with utmost severity; and is highly protected. Only members with a ::📣 CA-A:: pass are allowed to edit this section. All details enforced within is/are serious matter(s). ([Learn why.](craftdocs://open?blockId=82E22F22-B1CA-4F7F-AFED-3C5B66B86947\&spaceId=34ae8ebc-d508-7305-20e2-17e06364862c))

> CAIS-A notice placed by _**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date)`; unless otherwise cancelled.

The above notice is a CAIS-A template; the upcoming notice is a CANB-A template.

> ### `Any Title`

> This is a `Class Action Notice Box, Type A (CANB-A)`. Do not remove this Notice box, if you don’t have the required access level.

> by _\*\*\*_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(\*\*\*`member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_(`date);` unless otherwise cancelled.

* Type B (of CA) - has not been ratified yet.
* Type C

### Maintenance Notices

A maintenance notice serves to inform users that a specific area of the hub is currently undergoing development or maintenance. This notice can pertain to a sub-section, section, page, or other designated areas. When a maintenance notice is displayed, it supersedes any other notice or content placed below it, whether it involves a collection of headings or is positioned within the affected area, such as a particular heading. Yellow is the customary colour for a maintenance notice, and it can be merged with priority levels, but no other elements.

* The effectiveness of a priority level is contingent upon its placement within the notice box.
* If a priority level is situated either underneath the notice box, specifically in reference to a particular page or section, or within the affected area, such as a specific heading, it renders the priority level ineffective and voided immediately.

To communicate this information, it will be relayed through the maintenance notice or tag. The template for the notice is provided below, where the necessary details should be inserted, replacing the code blocks or monospaced font:

> ### 🧑‍🔧 This `section` is under Maintenance!

> We’ve currently polishing up a few things, and tightening up a few bolts to ensure that this section provides the best quality info possible. However, until then, this part may feel janky or contain invalid information. It’s safe to ignore this part until `this notice is removed`.

### Unreliable Content

The integrity of information posted on the Knowledge Hub is of utmost importance. Whilst we strive to ensure that all content shared is reliable and accurate, there may be instances where it becomes necessary to include content that may be deemed unreliable or inaccurate. In such instances, the respective section will be preceded by a Content notice, clearly indicating any discrepancies. It is essential to note that the Knowledge Hub cannot be held responsible for any personal interpretations made based on the content provided.

The template for the notice is:-

> #### Questionable Content

> The following section contains content of questionable accuracy from questionable sources. We expect you to take the given section with a pinch of salt… We will not be held responsible nor accountable for your interpretation of the given content.

### Sensitive Content

> “It is important to be sensible about sensitive information.”

> \- Carmel Jeru Joachim

In situations where content is identified as potentially harmful, sensitive, or related to ongoing events, it is important to acknowledge that the information provided on the Hub may be outdated or unreliable; and that we might not know everything. To ensure user awareness, we will display a notice above such content. However, it is crucial to note that the interpretation and understanding of the content remains solely the responsibility of the user, and the Hub cannot be held accountable for any user interpretations.

The template is:-

> #### ⚠️ **Caution**: Outdated or Potentially Harmful Information

> This section may contain sensitive or harmful information related to ongoing events. Please note that the content may be outdated or superseded by new information. We advise you to exercise caution when referring to this section, as we are not liable for your interpretation or understanding of the content. ([Learn why you’re seeing this.](https://desktop.craft.do:6776/editor/d/34ae8ebc-d508-7305-20e2-17e06364862c/bebb365f-d340-4b5a-8457-e20b221441b2/x/B9CAB24C-0984-4032-925A-C2ABAA8FA1BF))

> by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date).`

### Information Notice

The Information Notice is a useful tool for effectively communicating important information to users. This template is specifically designed to provide users with pertinent details and updates regarding various matters. It should be noted that this notice should only be utilised when there are no other existing templates that serve a similar purpose. By using the Information Notice, users can stay informed and up to date on critical information that may impact them.

The template for this notice is:

> #### Infobox

> `Content`

> ([Learn why you’re seeing this.](https://desktop.craft.do:6776/editor/d/34ae8ebc-d508-7305-20e2-17e06364862c/bebb365f-d340-4b5a-8457-e20b221441b2/x/D1DE0D13-52E1-4057-82AB-C5DA4271772F))

> by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_`(member)` , with automatic effect after \_\_\_\_`(date).`

### Opinions section

Some sections contain a person or a group of people’s collective opinion on a particular topic. Though the content would usually be something useful, it’s always better to take the opinions with a pinch of salt. People have different opinions, so it’s ok to agree to disagree. Opinions are never factually accurate, so don’t take them to be gospel truth.

The template for this notice is:-

> ### Opinions coming right up! 🎤

> This section contains opinions of the author(s), who have written out this piece of content. Your views may differ, and it’s always ok to agree to disagree. Never expect this information to be factually accurate, and the Hub will not take any responsibility for the views enclosed within, nor your interpretation of it.

**Catechism / Moral Science**

**Catechism**

Love for DB.

**Moral Science**

Love for DB.

Catechism and Moral Science are both important subjects that play a significant role in shaping an individual's moral values and spiritual beliefs. Catechism, typically taught in religious institutions, provides a comprehensive understanding of the teachings and principles of a particular faith. It helps individuals gain a deeper knowledge and connection with their religious beliefs and guides them in leading a virtuous and ethical life. On the other hand, Moral Science teaches individuals to differentiate between right and wrong, and develops their moral reasoning and decision-making skills. It provides a broader perspective on various ethical issues, enhancing their ability to make responsible choices and contribute to the well-being of society. Both Catechism and Moral Science are essential in nurturing individuals with strong moral character and guiding them towards a path of righteousness and integrity.

**Life cycle Policies**

The life cycle policy of the hub is an important part of the maintenance of the hub.

#### Active Support

The active support phase of the life.

The Hub was originally devised and created by

**Arbitration Committee (ArbCom)**

#### What is the Arbitration Committee?

Empowered by the Legal stature, the ArbCom is an independent wing of Project Troopers that acts as a court of last resort, i.e it’s job is to hear cases, and decide upon them using the powers granted to it.

#### Inspiration

We are modelled after the Indian Constitution’s powerful Judiciary and the English Wikipedia’s Arbitration Committee; which deal with cases and uphold the laws of their respective communities.

#### Are we in force yet?

Nope, but we plan to come into force soon… as soon we create our own structure by the power vested in us.

**The Troopers Board of Directors**

#### Who are we?

We are the top administrative unit of Project Troopers. Our aim is to make the day-to-day decision that are related to the running pf this project.

#### Are we too powerful?

In a sense, during the initial days of our existence, we were, and would have been truly powerful to put in place a proper structure to the Project.

However, we are still accountable to the members of the project and, and recently, the ArbCom.

#### What gives our authority?

Our legal basis and authority comes from our project’s [legal stature](https://desktop.craft.do:6776/editor/d/34ae8ebc-d508-7305-20e2-17e06364862c/bebb365f-d340-4b5a-8457-e20b221441b2/x/08EA7FDB-1658-441F-8D60-200B08BF37E2), which can be regarded as the document that provides some base framework to this project.

However, we existed long before the legal stature and the governing guidelines were in force. (Actually, we were the ones who formulated these guidelines themselves.) During those times, it was the immense faith and trust that our project members had in us that helped us to exist and gave us the power to diligently carry out the admin work of Project Troopers.

1. The speaker is discontinuing (sunsetting) the current "Psychology" group of the Troopers Project because there is already another Psychology group consisting of all Psychology students in Class 11. The speaker wants to respect the independence of this alternate group. However, if the alternate Psychology group wants to join the Troopers project, they are welcome to do so.

> Once again, an invitation is being extended to all individuals who possess materials or have an interest in contributing to the Troopers Hub. It is requested that volunteers actively maintain various sections such as "Psychology", "Computer Science", "Announcements", and "Homework", among others. Contributions ranging from graphic designing, physical drawings, materials, videos, and software-related skills (like API versioning, endpoints, etc) will be highly appreciated. A poll will be posted to gauge interest and availability.

### The Best Tips to cover a chapter

1. **Listen to your classes properly.** The most effective way to learn 80% of the concept is by listening properly in class or a lecture. Make proper notes that you understand so that you can go through them when you have the time.
2. **Go through your main reference material thoroughly**. Usually, the lecturer would give you a good idea or understanding of the concept. However, humans do make mistakes, and it’s best to go through your main reference material (e.g. NCERT) for factually accurate information.
3. **Even the main reference material may contain mistakes.** So, refer other books and internet sources. Watch videos and read through library books. Or better, choose an updated single source to always refer as an alternative.
4. **Keep your notes up to date.** Your notes are your last resort to help you go through the lessons properly. So, maintain them properly, and never lose them. They should have the latest information, and a small sample collection of sums and questions at one place. It can be both digital or physical. Use it wisely.
5. **Practice regularly.** The only way to improve your understanding of a concept, whether it is from biology or from chemistry, you must practice. Do a lot of sums, and do them regularly. Keep a repository of important sums for quick reference.
6. **Revise regularly.** "I do not fear the man who knows 1000 techniques. I fear the man who has practiced the same technique a 1000 times." Therefore, revise regularly. Do the same questions over and over again, to get a good grip on the concept.
7. **Help others to learn the concept.** The best way to solidify a concept is to teach it others. This will help you to recall the same thing, and you can become even clear in your conceptual understanding.
8. **Pareto's Principle.** The famous "80-20" principle can also be applied in studies. About 80% of the questions come from just 20% of the concept. So, note down the important topics and practice them regularly.

### Tips to study better

1. **Create a study space.** A study space can go a long way in making you better at something. A familiar environment helps you to kick into the grove faster and study better. It should ideally be a simple spacious place with a table, a chair and no distractions included.
2. **Identity Switching.** Instead of thinking that it is impossible to complete a subject within a given time frame; switch your personality for that particular moment.
3. **Nothing is impossible.** I know, it's easier said than done. But the reward and the satisfying feeling you get when you've achieve something that you've considered impossible… well nothing beats that, if you ask me.
4. **Study in slots.** Nothing can be easily achieved in one go. If you're working to improve your long-term studying skills and your retention capabilities, then study in slots. 1 hour or 2 hours or 3 hours, do what best suits you. Pomodoro techniques can also help.
5. **Have an accountability buddy to help you.** The best way to get back into the groove to study is to have an accountability buddy. Someone whom you can trust to keep some sort of checks and balances on you. It's very hard to find one today, but trust me, if you find one, you're very lucky. Like extremely rarely lucky.
6. **Build a network.** If your friends don't value the fact that you study well, you'll stop doing that in some time. Instead, find connections and meet with people who value you, your skill and knowledge. Share, learn and grow together.

### Archival Section

**Archives: Project Troopers**

In this section, we delve into the archival records of the Troopers Knowledge Hub during its inaugural year of operation, from 2023 to 2024. As we step back, we uncover the humble beginnings of the Troopers Knowledge Hub, a resource that was initially created to assist a small group of classmates with their schoolwork. Led by the Founder's vision to streamline information sharing and collaboration, the hub evolved into a valuable platform for academic support and communication within the group. Join us on a journey through the archival records of this pioneering period, where the focus was on homework assignments, important announcements, and various initiatives undertaken by the Troopers. Explore the early days of the hub and gain insight into its foundation and growth, paving the way for what it has become today. ::As we explore these records, it is important to note that the content may be considered outdated or depreciated, but it is preserved here for historical and reference purposes.::

> ### Founder's Note

> In the beginning, I started the Troopers Knowledge Hub as an internal effort for only my fellow colleagues, to help them catch up on the latest happenings in school, get the latest notes and a lot more in one place. I found out that this method was more efficient than answering everyone's queries on a one-on-one basis… 😅. This record here directly deals with the operations of the Hub in the founding year, where it was only directed to help my class mates of Class 11. Thus, this section is not relevant to the current structure of the hub.

> However, I've created this record to ensure transparency in the past proceedings of the hub. Back then, there was no legal foray, nothing of that sort.

**The Noticeboard Initiative**

**Leader:** [Deepan SaI](craftdocs://users?id=5ce369d5-9030-3396-e377-626a99465ad3)\*\* (Deepan Sai)\*\* **Implementing Coordinator: Faheema Nasrin**

### About

The idea is to beautify the class noticeboard… and make it more engaging for students. Currently, the noticeboard is a dull and boring space, cluttered with outdated announcements and faded posters. As the leader of The Noticeboard Initiative, I believe that by transforming this space, we can create a more vibrant and informative environment for everyone.

Firstly, I propose to clear out all the outdated notices and posters. This will not only provide us with a clean canvas but also ensure that the information displayed is up-to-date and relevant. By removing old materials, we can make room for new and exciting content that will capture students' attention.

Next, I envision incorporating interactive elements into the noticeboard. This could include digital screens displaying rotating announcements, upcoming events, and important deadlines. By integrating technology, we can capture the interest of our tech-savvy generation and make the noticeboard more interactive and engaging.

Furthermore, I plan to allocate sections of the noticeboard to different student groups and clubs. These sections would act as a platform for students to showcase their activities, achievements, and upcoming events. This will foster a sense of belonging and pride within the student community while also promoting the various extracurricular opportunities available.

Additionally, I aim to include a suggestion box where students can provide feedback and suggestions for the noticeboard. This will ensure that the noticeboard remains a dynamic and student-driven initiative. By actively involving the students in the decision-making process, we can tailor the content and design to their preferences and needs.

Lastly, I believe it is crucial to assign a team responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the noticeboard. This team will regularly update and curate the content, ensuring that it remains visually appealing and informative. By involving students in this responsibility, we can develop leadership skills and cultivate a sense of ownership over their school environment.

In conclusion, The Noticeboard Initiative aims to transform the class noticeboard into a vibrant, engaging, and student-driven space. By clearing out outdated materials, incorporating interactive elements, and involving student groups, we can create an environment that captures students' attention and keeps them informed.

You'll be rewarded with college merits for your contribution to the noticeboard.

From this academic year onwards Apollo Shine has initiated digitalisation of medical history of students. On account of this, Apollo Shine has requested the parents to record the medical history through an App _"SHINE Parivar"_. Parents were asked to download the app and fill in the medical history of your ward. This was mandatory. The SHINE Parivar App can be downloaded using either of the following links:-

* For Androids

[Shine Parivar - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.humanfractal.shine)

* For iPhones

[‎Shine Parivar](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/shine-parivar/id6444183424)

Check the attached video and follow the steps for registration.

The registration process should be completed by 23rd of July. For students who couldn't update the details on the App, they were requested to bring in a "typed-out" form of the same before 31 July, 2023…
