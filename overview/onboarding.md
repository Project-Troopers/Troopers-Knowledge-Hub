### What is Project Troopers?

Well, in the simplest form, Project Troopers is an educational initiative started by me, Sugeeth, to help all students who are a part of it to solve their doubts, access learning materials easily and allow them to share their understanding (i.e create their own materials) with everyone.

This is our second year of operations, which was sanctioned and approved by the majority of all troopers who were part of this project.

This Project was quite small towards the start, with only including my classmates. Pretty soon, we inducted Jugzards and expanded our outreach to the entire senior secondary part of my school. We're on the process of onboarding others too, across India and maybe other places too! The current outreach operation is aimed at connecting students everywhere.&#x20;

&#x20;We are a non-profit non-financial non-governmental organisation, a student body for the students, by the students and of the students. We are not linked with any school, any institution. And our structure is pretty military-themed, so don't mind if we use a lot of military related terms.

We are governed by our governing guidelines.&#x20;

### Our Initiatives and Structure

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### The Doubt Groups

We have groups where we, at Project Troopers, connect to every student who wishes to participate, access and view project Materials. Anyone can express their views, opinions, and doubts, while being civil, moral, and humane.

These groups are created with certain interest groups in mind, called "Regiments", which cater to specific audience groups. We also have some "corps" too, which cater to specific subjects under the regiments.

All regiments and related corps are banded together under a division.&#x20;

Each division is related to a particular batchâ€¦.&#x20;

* Brigadiers refer to the batch which studied Class 10 in the academic year 2022-2023, Class 11 in the academic year 2023-2024, and studying class 12 in the academic year 2024-2025. It consists of the following regiments and corps:
  * The First Brigadier Regiment \
    (Code: 1BRDB11A)
  * The Second Brigadier Regiment \
    (Code: 2BRDB11B)
  * The Third Brigadier Regiment\
    (Code: 3BRSRMS)
  * The Fourth Brigadier Regiment\
    (Code: 4BRAKSH)
  * The Common Biology Brigadier Corps
  * The First Biology Brigadier Corps
  * The Second Biology Brigadier Corps
  * The Common Computer Birigadier Corps
  * The First Computer Brigadier Corps
* Subedars refer to the batch which studied Class 10 in the academic year 2023-2024 and Class 11 in the academic year 2024-2025.

Now, each group has its own set of admins. And each division will provide us with a directorâ€¦

Each group has its own WhatsApp communication groups under the "Project Troopers" community.

### The Board of Directors

This project was originally run by a core group. Since we expanded, we needed only a few trust-worthy people to take decisions, on behalf of the people on the Project. So, we have a Board of Directors, the highest administrative authority of the project that is allowed to take decisions. The board is headed by the Collaborator In-Charge, who will be appointed by the Board. Each decision taken by the board goes through a vote.

### The Troopers Knowledge Hub

It is our repository of information, here we share our files and knowledge. It is available on this same website and is run by a group of volunteers, called collaborators. If you wish to contribute to the hub, let us know. To access the home page, click below!

{% embed url="https://project-troopers.gitbook.io/" %}

The Hub does contain some materials that the contributors create and some materials from other sources. We release the material that we created under the Creative Commons 4.0 Share-Alike License.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project Troopers Archive Mirror

_(Formerly Jugzards Archive Mirror)_

It is the place where we archive our materials that we have on the hub. The Department of IT of Project Troopers maintains it.

{% embed url="https://spreecordinard.wixsite.com/jugzards" %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### And so many other structures too!

We have an election committee, an ArbCom to solve internal disputes, an Office of Legal Consult, Department of IT and other structures too.&#x20;
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Governing Guidelines

We are self-governed by a set of guidelines, applicable to all viewers and contributors alike. You can read them up over [here](governing-guidelines/), or click on the box below.

{% content-ref url="governing-guidelines/" %}
[governing-guidelines](governing-guidelines/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The core document of the Governing Guidelines is the Legal Stature, which is the base that provides us with a basic framework and gives us a set of legal protections.

{% content-ref url="governing-guidelines/our-legal-stature.md" %}
[our-legal-stature.md](governing-guidelines/our-legal-stature.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you have any doubts, please ask us, and we will help you. Thank you for joining Project Troopers!
