# TECRR Act, 2024

## Introduction

1. This act will be henceforth named the "Election Committee Rules and Regulations Act, 2024". It will come into effect after the Election Committee Head approves of this bill and turns into official policy.
2. The approved shorthand for this act will be the "TECRR 2024".
3. These rules are binding on all participants of Project Troopers, as empowered by the Legal Stature through the Governing Guidelines.
4. This page forms the basis of the Election Committee and its workings. The Election Committee and its members are required to work as envisioned by the limits enshrined in the Legal Stature.
5. The Election Committee and its proceedings will be subject to the review process of ArbCom.
6. The official shorthand of the the term "Troopers Election Committee" will be the "TEC". It will automatically refer to the Election Committee that this act governs.

## The Election Committee Structure

1. The Election Committee will be an autonomous body under Project Troopers.
2. It will be headed by the **Election Committee Head,** who has the authority to delegate administrative duties and titles to the members of the Election Committee. He will selected via the internal voting process mentioned in this document.
3. It will consist of at least 5 members who are internally selected by the collegium.
4. Each member's tenure will be for 1 year each, until they wish to be reselected. During this tenure, the members are automatically appointed as admins of Project Troopers, which can not be revoked by anyone except via the Impeachment Protocol defined in this act or any future act thereof.
5. A person can only be selected for a maximum of 5 terms. After that, they will be automatically disqualified from the selection process by this act. This clause in this act will automatically applicable to all members who were selected at least once while this act is in force; even if this clause is amended in the future.
6. Once every 6 months, the election committee is supposed to compile a report of the productivity of Project Troopers as a whole. This job, however, can be assigned to others under the discretion of the ArbCom and Board of Directors combined for a particular year.

## Selection of members to the Election Committee (aka the Selection Bye-Laws)

1. The collegium will consist of the members of the Election Committee, who will be vetted by the Arbitration Committee.
2. The collegium is empowered to select the members of the TEC, and has the power to add anyone to the collegium who have been vetted by the ArbCom to decide the next members of the TEC.
3. Each member will make a public disclosure of pertinent details as declared by the Arbitration Committee at the time of selection.
4. If the ArbCom stands dissolved or impending a major election that would result in a major recomposition of the ArbCom at the time of the internal selection, the Board of Directors will order a sub-committee to be formed to vet each member of the Election Committee.
5. The vetting process should happen within 5 days after the election. If the Board of Directors or ArbCom are unable to submit the results of the vetting process to the collegium, and if they hadn't approached the collegium to ask for an extension (which will be up to the discretion of the collegium to grant the extension); then the member will automatically approved as an member of election committee. However, if the respective body submits the vetting results even after this period, it would be still be considered and an evaluation will be re-conducted by the collegium.

## Powers of the Election Committee

1. The Election Committee is the only authorised body to conduct elections to the ArbCom and the Board of Directors.
2. They have the power to enforce a Model Code of Conduct during the elections.
3. They will individually vet and verify whether the candidate wishing to participating in any election will be eligible to do so.
4. They can observe the workings of the Board by appointing a liaison to the Board to see their internal proceedings.

## Member tenure

The tenure of the members of the Election Committee will be for 1 year. However, only half of the Election Committee's can retire in any time. The collegium is required to choose new members before the next phase of tenure expiration.

## Impeachment of a Election Committee member

Impeachment can happen in two ways:

1. If the ArbCom finds by a case that a Election Committee member is uncapable of running for office due to degradation of their mental faculties or due to failure in following the Governing Guidelines, they can attract a fine if the offense is minor or can warrant an immediate termination of them from their posts.
2. The Board of Directors and/or the Election Committee can start a process through which they can examine the activities of the particular member in question. If they find anything which goes against the rules enshrined in the Governing Guidelines, they can dismiss the person from their post.

They are thus not allowed to ever take up a post in the TEC. Whenever a charge is brought against the member, they will not be allowed to participate in the affairs of the TEC.

## Voting Process for matters under the purview of the Election Committee

The election committee will follow a set of standardised voting process similar to that of the Board of Directors.

When a member wants to propose new ideas to the TEC or take any decision related to the project, they have to follow a few set of procedures before implementing them, in successive order.

1. Share the idea with the committee
2. Allow the whole of the committee to debate upon the idea, including the pros and cons. (Can be skipped if a general consensus is already reached.)
3. Conduct a poll asking the TEC members to vote.
4. If the idea receives either a:-
   1. 50%+ majority approval by the active TEC members who have not abstained from voting. All inactive TEC members are automatically considered "abstained" from voting on the particular idea, where a member is regarded as inactive if they do not attend to TEC matters for 2 weeks. They will be rewarded the 'active' status once they resume their activities in matters of TEC.
   2. 75% majority by the members of the Troopers Project (in the case when the TEC members are not available)
   3. **TEC head** approval through the emergency protocol, if the TEC Head has been given the office of CIC of Project Troopers, by the Crisis Protocol, which will be defined by the **Distribution of Powers Act (DOPA)**.

then, it has to be implemented with immediate effect.

1. Any idea that affects a particular division of the Project and their operations must be discussed with their admins.
2. After implementation or veto, it has to be recorded below. The Project docs must be also updated in parallel to reflect the same.

No TEC decision can be implemented without at least three-fourths of the TEC voicing their opinion regarding it. If the no. of voting members (i.e non-abstained) fall below the set threshold, then it is mandatory that some members must change their opinion via a re-vote. If the threshold is still not satisfied after two re-votes or if the no. of inactive members impedes the voting procedure (during the first vote), then the ArbCom is authorised to hold elections to members of the board by the Project Members.

## Major Changes

* Any changes that affect the basic essence of this act will have to go through the extended voting process as mentioned in the Legal Stature.
* The Election Committee is however allowed to make other changes to this act from time to time.
