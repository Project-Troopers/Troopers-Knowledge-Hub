#### Joint Protection and Restrictions

This section of the act can individually referred to as the JPR. Any body that is under the purview of this section can be referred to as an “JPR Body”. If a body is to be awarded with JPR status, then this act must be amended to reflect the same.

However, these discussions and information placed on record should be published and documented under the respective body’s pages after the final decision has been arrived at.
2. **Autonomous Operation**: A JPR body is to be autonomous in decision making in its entirety; with its decision can be subject to review of the ArbCom. However, if any act promulgated by the body or Legal Stature wishes to place some checks and balances on its power, then it will lose that specific part of its autonomous nature.
3. **Transparency and Accountability:** All final decisions once taken must be published publicly along with the internal discussions, information and proceedings; except if otherwise mentioned by an act passed by the body which supersedes this. The only way to supersede this clause is to satisfy the **AP89 protection provision**, as mentioned in this act.

The Department will have administrative clearance and the ability to create and supervise all IT tools used by Project Troopers.

#### Protection of Acts

_The clauses that already exist in this section in its latest and recently ammended form is protected by the AP96 provision enclosed within this section. New clauses, however, can be inserted into this section, which will not violate the AP96 protection provision._

Any act or section or its clauses, after being passed, can be protected by any one of the following provisions:-

During those situations the Election Committee will take up the functions of the ArbCom temporarily. However, the TEC is required to conduct the elections and declare the results within one month of the ArbCom becoming non-functional.
2. **Election Committee Limitations:** If the TEC is unable to function due to falling below the minimum set threshold as in the **TECRR** Act; then the admins of Project Troopers will take up the functioning of the Election Committee. They will be granted temporary protection from the Board to remove them from their admin post. They are required to form a collegium and appoint Project members to the Election Committee as the first order of business. After this the non-elected admins will go back to the
3. **Board of Directors Limitations:** If the Board is unable to execute any decision because it has been completely dissolved, then the Election Committee and ArbCom will jointly take up the functions of the Board of Directors. The TEC is required to restore the Board within 15 days by conducting the elections, declaring the results, and swearing the new directors in.
4. **Extreme Crisis:** If there is a case where the ArbCom, Election Committee and the Board are all limited as defined in the previous clauses and if there are not more than 5 admins, then the remaining admins along with the entirety of Project Troopers will take up the function of the JPR bodies combined, with the principle of majority vote. The remaining admins will jointly execute the office of the Collaborator In-Charge, though they will not be bearers of the office. The first order of business will be to restore the Election Committee.

#### Unified Impeachment Protocol

Impeachment of a member through this protocol can occur through any of the following mechanisms:

1. **Internal ArbCom Findings**: If the ArbCom, through a formal case review, determines that a member is incapable of fulfilling their duties due to mental incapacity or violation of the Governing Guidelines, appropriate actions will be taken. Minor offenses may result in a fine, while serious violations may lead to immediate termination from their position.
2. **Two-Thirds Vote**: A JPR body can initiate an impeachment process. They will examine the member's activities for compliance with the Governing Guidelines. If violations are found, the member can be recommended for dismissal from their post. This recommendation will be up for discussion and debate in an Extraordinary General Meeting, and they can impeach the said member by a two-thirds majority vote of an Extraordinary General Meeting.
3. **Project Members**: If an 85% majority of the members of the Project vote to impeach a member, the member will undergo a review process by a specially formed Review Committee consisting of members of the TEC, Board, and Project admins. They will examine the member's activities for compliance with the Governing Guidelines. If violations are found, the member can be dismissed from their post by the Review Committee.

The details and proceedings must be properly documented in the Troopers Knowledge Hub. Once charges are brought against a member, they will be suspended from participating in the affairs of the respective authority that they hold which was challenged and automatically recused from decision-making duties until the matter is resolved.

**Post-Impeachment Consequences**

1. **Permanent Disqualification**: Impeached members are permanently disqualified from holding any position within the respective body that their authority arises from, unless the dismissal was due to medical reasons. In such cases, the member may be eligible for re-election if the underlying medical condition is resolved.
2. **Any reasonable restriction**: These restrictions must be within the purview of Project Troopers and can be appealed by the impeached member in front of the ArbCom or the EGM. The ArbCom or the EGM can decide to relax, strengthen and/or remove the restrictions.

**End of the Act.**

_This page is part of a series of guidelines that govern Project Troopers. Do not take these laws lightly._

[^1]: This clause does not mean, however, that "only directors should occupy the office of the CIC". The Legal Stature of Project Troopers, while it gives the CIC the "level" of ownership, director, and [#the-ca-a-pass](../../editorial-code-of-conduct.md#the-ca-a-pass "mention"); it does not make them "director"-per-se nor "owner"-per-se. Rather, the post automatically bestows upon them powers **similar** to that of a director, or owner; which is required to ensure that the office-bearer can execute his duties without hinderance.
