# ðŸŽ© The Troopers Board of Directors

{% hint style="danger" %}
### **Protected JPR body.**

Under the _Joint Protections and Restrictions (JPR) section_ of the _Distribution of Powers Act, 2024 (DOPA 2024)_; the **Board of Directors** have been designated as a _protected body_ that automatically come under the purview of the provisions of the JPR.

They are bound to follow the laws applicable to JPR bodies; and each member of this body have a say during an _Extraordinary General Meeting_ (basically a special meeting of all JPR bodies) of Project Troopers.
{% endhint %}

### Who are we?

The Board was originally created by the First Brigadier Regiment when they sanctioned the **2nd year of official operations** of this project; through an internal vote. _(Back then, they were considered the core group of Project Troopers and thus all decisions were run through by them, even when the Project expanded to accommodate a 2nd group.)_&#x20;

The Board is the top administrative unit of Project Troopers. &#x20;

**Our job**? To ensure that the members of Project Troopers do not get burdened with the official matters of this Project; like administration, issues etc.&#x20;

As the Project expanded to accommodate others too, the first session of the Board voted to put the Governing Guidelines into force by approving the Legal Stature of Project Troopers; which is a core group of documents that set some basic rules and establishes some protections for the Project, effectively creating a _model baseline for all Project members_.

### Are we too powerful?

In a sense, during the initial days of our existence, we were, and would have been truly powerful to put in place a proper structure to the Project. However, we are still accountable to the members of the project and, and recently, the ArbCom.

Our principle is to allow the members of the Project to be able to create and maintain elements of the Project on their own, as a community. **Our community is our greatest asset.** We are an extension of the community.

### What gives our authority?

Our legal basis and authority comes from [our-legal-stature.md](../our-legal-stature.md "mention") of our project, which can be regarded as the document that provides some base framework to this project.

However, we existed long before the legal stature and the governing guidelines were in force. (Actually, we were the ones who formulated these guidelines themselves.) During those times, it was the immense faith and trust that our project members had in us that helped us to exist and gave us the power to diligently carry out the admin work of Project Troopers.

## Directors in the Board

The directors are nominees / admins who have been selected by the people or the CIC to lead the Project. They will have control over all the decisions of the Project's administrative matters. These directors will then constitute the Troopers Board of Directors, which has the power to halt, proceed, change, allow or deny any administrative decision before they are put into action.&#x20;

There can be a maximum of 15 directors. Each director is entitled to full administrator rights over the Project Admins, and can request for admin rights to a particular section as and when required. The directors of the Second Session of the Board of Directors are:

* **K.S. Harshavardhan** \
  _representative of the First Brigadier Regiment_
* **Deepan Sai** \
  _representative of the core group that started Project Troopers_

## Procedures of the Board

A separate Board protocol page to be released soon.

### Introduction (and essence)

_An excerpt from the Legal Stature._

1. The directors are nominees / admins who have been selected by the people or the CIC to lead the Project. They will have control over all the decisions of the Project's administrative matters. These directors will then constitute the Troopers Board of Directors, which has the power to halt, proceed, change, allow or deny any administrative decision before they are put into action. More about the board will be given in this document.
2. The Board of Directors is the deciding authority of the Project, i.e the _de-facto **head**_. It is where the directors are to propose new ideas, solve conflicts and decide on the future of the Project. This Group will, as is, follow all the rules outlined previously. The directors are in no way above the law. This group will only be composed of the volunteering admins (aka the directors).
3. Some directors can be considered inactive, if they can not respond to any board activity for 2 weeks or notify the board that they can not attend to the matters of the project temporarily. All other directors will be considered active.
4. The creation of any sub-group belonging to the Project will also be subject to approval by a majority of the directors and the CIC.
5. All Board decisions are required to documented well, with transparent proceedings. The board can form its own internal processes, rules and sub-committees. _**The current director(s), with appointed or assigned any roles and their records; the board and its records, and decisions will be maintained under the governing guidelines section of the project.**_
6. **The Collaborator-in-Charge (CIC):** The CIC is the _de-jure_ head of the Knowledge Hub with level of Ownership, director and a CA-A pass. He has the power to decide upon the administrative matters of the Knowledge Hub, but not without the knowledge and approval of the Board of directors.
7.  **Proposing ideas or take a decision**

    When a director wants to propose new ideas to the Project's infrastructure or take any decision related to the project, they have to follow a few set of procedures before implementing them, in successive order.

    1. Share the idea with the Board
    2. Allow the whole of the Board to debate upon the idea, including the pros and cons. (Can be skipped if a general consensus is already reached.)
    3. Conduct a poll asking the board members to vote.
    4.  If the idea receives either a:-

        1. 50%+ majority approval by the active directors who have not abstained from voting. All inactive directors are automatically considered "abstained" from voting on the particular idea.
        2. 75% majority by the members of the Troopers Project (in the case when the admins are not available)
        3. super-admin approval through the emergency protocol

        then, it has to be implemented with immediate effect.
    5. Any idea that affects a particular division of the Project and their operations must be discussed with their admins.
    6. After implementation or veto, it has to be recorded below. The Project docs must be also updated in parallel to reflect the same.
8. No board decision can be implemented without at least three-fourths of the board voicing their opinion regarding it. If the no. of voting directors (i.e non-abstained) fall below the set threshold, then it is mandatory that some directors must change their opinion via a re-vote. If the threshold is still not satisfied after two re-votes or if the no. of inactive directors impedes the voting procedure (during the first vote), then the board is authorised to hold elections to vote directors to the board by the Project Members.

#### The Board of Directors (Additional Powers and Restrictions)

1. The Board of Directors can consult with members of the Project in their own capacity before offering their vote for a particular decision.
2. The Board has the power to appoint sub-committees to oversee the operations of the Project, and delegate the power of Board approval to those bodies.
3. The Board has the power to create new committees which may or may not be a JPR body, but must be approved by all the JPR bodies in a joint session.
4. The Board of Directors will have the power to create new seats for the purposes of administration, ensuring that there will only be a maximum of 15 members in the Board.
5. The Board of Directors can recommend removing only vacant seats from the Board of Directors. However, the actual removal process will only take when an Extraordinary General Meeting is held, where the recommendation will be put to vote.

### Laws of the Board (as created through resolutions)

1. The CIC will have administrator access to all the groups.
2. The tenure of each elected director is staged for 6 months.&#x20;
