Laws shall be reframed and simplified involving no legal actions or requirements- law shall only guide the members of the group.

Voting results have not been released yet.

### Resolution #0006: Changes to the Election Committee and Board responsibilities

_April 28, 2024_

A resolution was passed that includes the following points:

* To allow a member from the election committee to stay as a liaison between the board and election committee. This will invariably mean that they will have to be part of this group, but they won't be a director. They would somewhat close to an advisor, who can request or initiate proposal in the group, but can't vote on them.
* To extend the timeframe to conduct the election for the next replacement director and put the responsibility of conducting the election on the election committee instead of Sugeeth, the caretaker CIC (as his caretaker period will end today night at 11:59 PM)
* To give the election committee the power to appoint any member of Project Troopers to itself (and invariably make them as administrators).
* To allow the election committee head to have admin access to all the groups and works of Project Troopers.
* To give each director a responsibility to maintain over a particular section of the Project Trooper operations on decisions that does not need Board approval, pertaining to that particular section. (Eg: Class 12 operations, Hub educational operations, Legal operations etc)
* To define the option of 'recluse' as (I) automatic, when the involvement of a director in voting is controversial or is about a case which is about them or if they are an outgoing director (II) manual, as decided by the board
* To initiate an internal consensus (discussion) about the feasibility of giving the directors a particular tenure to serve in, and to put forth laws that would allow only 1/3rd of the board members' tenure to expire at any given point in time, with reasonable exceptions.

### Consensus #0002: Proposal for Expanding Computer Corps Program Summary

A student, recommended by a friend of Aakash, has expressed interest in joining the exclusive Computer Corps. The current structure limits participation to students from our school.

#### Considerations

1. **Inclusivity vs. Exclusivity**: Balancing the program's exclusiveness with potential benefits of inclusivity.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assessing if expansion could strain resources or diminish the quality of the program.
3. **Precedent Setting**: Deciding whether this case sets a precedent for future admissions from outside the current internal setup.

#### Recommendations

1. **Expand Internally**: Allow the interested student to join the current Computer Corps, evaluating the impact on the group dynamics and resources.
2. **Create a New Group**: Alternatively, establish a separate computer group for external participants, maintaining the exclusiveness of the original Corps but fostering outreach and inclusivity.

#### Decision Requested

The Board of Directors was kindly asked to deliberate on the mentioned recommendations and make a decision regarding the most suitable approach for the inclusion of the student and potential future external candidates.

#### Discussion

1. **Eric**: Suggested that the person may join the existing group and remaining silent.
2. **Deepan**: Advocated for a separate group, highlighting:
   1. Irrelevance of class-related updates for some members
   2. The possibility of sharing targeted resources
   3. Easier access to study materials for all
   4. Enhanced privacy
3. **Harshavardhan**: Supported the creation a separate group to maintain privacy and relevance for school members.

**Formulated Consensus**: Allow them to participate in the computer science division as a new group.
