_Orange indicates that the activity is currently ongoing._

<details>

<summary><strong>Consensus #0020:</strong> Temporary Suspension of Board Operations &#x26; Administrative Adjustments</summary>

T**imeframe**: January 15, 2025 to February 14, 2025\
<mark style="color:green;">**APPROVED AND ANNOUNCED**</mark>**.**

**Objective:** To align operations of Project Troopers; **planning for a temporary leadership transition and operational adjustments** during the examination period.

#### **Adopted Decisions:**

**Decision 1:**

From **February 15, 2025, 12:01 AM IST, to April 7, 2025, 11:59 PM IST**, Brigadiers will be occupied with important examinations. During this period, they are **exempt from administrative and operational duties**, except in cases of operational emergencies. The **Project Troopers Board session will be also during be suspended during this period** to allow volunteers, including Brigadiers, to focus on their preparations. As a result, there may be **delays in responses** to official queries raised during this time.

During this period, **Subedars will assume expanded roles and responsibilities**. They will either take on additional functions as assigned or exercise greater authority in roles where their powers are typically limited due to proportional participation.&#x20;

The **WhatsApp Community and Website will continue to function as usual**, ensuring that essential communication channels remain open.

**Decison 2:**

Furthermore, in the absence of the Board, **decisions will be made by the directors from the Subedars through the board channel**. If both the **Collaborator In-Charge (CIC) and Assistant CIC** are unavailable, **Director Nithin Antonio Dominic** will assume the responsibilities of the CIC and execute autonomous decisions as necessary. These measures will remain in effect **until the end of the Second Board Session or until further notice**. Following this, the **Board will be dissolved**. Additionally, to avoid the inconvenience of conducting elections during the examination period, the **current Board session has been extended until April 15, 2025**.

<summary><strong>Resolution #0019: Approval is granted for member Kevin Adam to join using a third-party device.</strong></summary>

**Timeframe**: January 15, 2025 to January 17, 2025\
<mark style="color:green;">**PASSED**</mark>**.**

**Question raised by Sugeeth Jayaraj, the CIC**: There’s a guy called Kevin Adam whose mom is a teacher in a school. He used to participate in this project through his own phone. However, his phone is now in a state of disrepair… Could we allow that guy to participate in Project Troopers through his mom’s phone?

**Why board approval was necessary?** Historically, the Project has mandated members to participate via their own devices, with exceptions granted to devices that do not belong to teachers in an educational institution. However, this is the first time a request has been raised to the board to allow a member to participate from a teacher's phone.

The matter was put to vote, and the decision was as follows.

**Vote results: All the directors unanimously approved it.**\
&#xNAN;_&#x56;ote results are in the for-against-neutral-abstained-reclused format._\
&#xNAN;_**Timeframe**:_ From May 31, 2024 to 19/07/2024 at 2:00 PM.

**Approvers**: Nithin, K.S. Harshavardhan, Deepan, Sugeeth (CIC), Abdul Hafeez, Joanna, Hari Karthik\
**Detractors**: _None_\
**Neutral:** _None_\
**Abstained**: _None_\
**Reclused**: _None_

_Thus, Kevin Adam re-joined the Project via his mother's phone on the same day._

<summary>Deliberation #0018: <strong>The Hunt for a New Logo</strong> </summary>

**Timeframe:** January 07, 2025 to February 14, 2025\
<mark style="color:green;">**ENDED.**</mark>

**Objective:** Project Troopers has heavily relied on graphics from Freepik to officiate its status and has used multiple images in the past as its logo. As the Project has started to mature, Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A., the CIC, felt it was necessary to adopt an official logo for Project Troopers to use standardised across all of its operations.&#x20;

The currently proposed logo is:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Project Troopers logo new.jpg>)

The old logos are also under consideration; and there are other internal discussion happening on these lines too.&#x20;

However, the Board has decided to allow the usage of all logos, old and new, to represent Project Troopers.

Mr. Vishal Subramaniam of ArbCom has also agreed to hunt for a new logo.

<summary>Resolution #00<strong>17:</strong> Acquisition of Jugzards and Incorporation of Assets</summary>

**Timeframe**: _From October 13, 2024 to February 07, 2025._\
<mark style="color:green;">**Approved.**</mark>

**Objective:** To consolidate the operations of Jugzards into Project Troopers via the Power of the IoFA 2024

Jugzards was the backend service where Project Troopers archived their documents of materials. The agreement to acquire Jugzards was proposed in order to improve operational efficiency and improve compliance.

Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A. was reclused from the process of voting on the side of Project Troopers as he had a personal stake in the matter.

The approval process to start the incorporation entered a stalemate on November 03, 2024; with the Board of Directors adopting a neutral stance in a majority sweep.&#x20;

A consensus discussion was initiated to work out the problems and restart the approval process, and the bill has also been transferred to ArbCom for approval.

_Voting details are not available due to it being done as a consensus discussion, and the other voting details are sparse due to extended voting sessions and internal dilemma._

The ArbCom approved the bill on February 2, 2025 at 6:00 PM. View details of voting at ArbCom's page.

The agreement was signed by the respective representatives on February 06, 2025. A detailed action-response page has been linked below.

<summary>Consensus #0016: Structure of Bills and Acts, 2024 (SOBA)</summary>

**Timeframe**: _From November 29, 2024 to December 15, 2024_\
<mark style="color:green;">**PASSED.**</mark>

**Objective**: Formulate a set of guidelines for better framing of Bills and Acts in the future by the Board and/or its members.

By virtue of no opposing views, the Board of Directors henceforth implement the SOBA Bill as a framework (not an act) that serves as the guardrails for the creation of future acts.

**Motion passed by virtue of no opposing views.** \
**Matter Dismissed.**

<summary>Consensus #0015: Decision regarding a Special Resources Group</summary>

**Timeframe**: December 04, 2024 (07:58 PM) to December 06, 2024 (11:35 PM)

Sugeeth, the CIC, had added a group called "Special Resources Group" to Project Troopers, specifically designed to cater to individuals who were willing to give their utmost effort for JEE Mains Session 1. This group was intended to be a closed, focused environment. The members included handpicked students who were also Sugeeth's classmates, and the group closely aligned with an integrated program offered by their school. Within the group, discussions and resource-sharing centered around the program while also covering other relevant topics. Sugeeth clarified that the group was not an official communication channel for the school program but rather a self-help group for study companions.

Normally, decisions about creating or expanding Project Troopers’ member base and group structures were made administratively. However, Sugeeth had sought permission and input before proceeding, as this initiative was unprecedented within Project Troopers. While transparency was a core value of Project Troopers, Sugeeth believed that keeping the group invisible was necessary to maintain its integrity and fulfill its purpose as a focus group for JEE Mains preparation.

To address this, Sugeeth had proposed three options:

1. Allow the group to exist invisibly within Project Troopers to serve its purpose.
2. Create similar focus groups for other exams to benefit other members.
3. Spin off the Special Resources Group into a separate entity, given its secrecy and alignment with the school’s integrated program.

Sugeeth had invited additional suggestions, opinions, or concerns and posted a primary poll with these three options to initiate discussions. Members were also encouraged to share their thoughts through messages.

**Decision taken by the Board of Directors:**

The Board of Directors have hereby agreed, by consensus, to siphon off the Special Resources Group from Project Troopers as its ideals do not agree with the Ethos of the mission of Project Troopers and the fact that it closely aligns with another program outside Project Troopers.

However, it has been acknowledged that there is a need for the existence of focus groups for particular exams. (Concern of 1 director)

**Motion passed by virtue of absolute majority.** \
**Matter Dismissed.**

_Other internal discussions have been omitted, as they are not relevant._

<summary>Advice of the Board #0014: Creation and Maintenance of a Project Troopers YouTube Channel</summary>

_From October 02, 2024 to October 18, 2024._

The Board of Directors were informed on October 8, 2024 that a Project Troopers YouTube Channel was started. Their thoughts and ideas were welcomed for the Branding of the Channel.

A teacher was initially willing to create content for free, in an arrangement (created on October 8, 2024) where both Project Troopers and the teacher will not gain monetary gains from the channel. The teacher, after a few videos, withdrew from the agreement on October 18, 2024.

This was part of a larger advice request regarding the entry of Project Troopers to help fill up the vacuum caused by the fall of BYJU's.

<details>

<summary>Consensus #0013: Creation of the Board Election Protocol, Rules and Regulations 2024</summary>

_From October 06, 2024 till February 13, 2025._\
&#xNAN;_<mark style="color:green;">Ended.</mark>_

**Objective**: To create a standardised protocol between the Election Committee and Board for the Smooth conduct of elections to the Board of Directors.

Discussion Started by Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A. (Collaborator In-Charge)

**Original Points for Consideration:**

* To ensure that the CIC can not appoint arbitrary directors that exceed the number of elected directors
* To ensure that the board remains suspended but still has temporary admin powers and latent decision rights until a new board comes into force, when the elections happen

**These points were accepted and the bill was handed back over to the Election Committee. View Election Committee Documentation for more detailed.**

<details>

<summary>Consensus #0012: Appointment of Office of Legal Consult</summary>

From _September 30, 2024 @ 06:38 PM, but ended ex-officio on December 17, 2024 via an Executive Directive of the CIC._\
<mark style="color:red;">**DISMISSED without discussion, appointment made by CIC**</mark><mark style="color:green;">**.**</mark>

**Objective**: To select the officebearer for the Office of Legal Consult (OLC).

Discussion put forth by Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A.; and he has put forth a recommendation to make K.S. Harshavardhan the officebearer of the Office of Legal Consult.

No decision has been taken regarding this consensus yet. On result of this stalemate; the office of the CIC excercised its powers and appointed Ishana Santhosh as the Head of the Office of Legal Consult on December 17, 2024; to quell the ruckus caused by the Second Brigadier Regiment. The person accepted the post, and she will continue to hold it as per the rules of the DOPA 2024.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Consensus #0011: Selecting the CIC and Group Operations</summary>

_September 28, 2024 @ 07:48 PM_

**Objective**: To discuss and select the next CIC of Project Troopers, and start an orientation session for the directors

**Things to discuss on the Agenda:-**

* To introduce the directors to each other and ensure that they are given proper guidance on the Project's structure (more like an Orientation session).
* To constitute the Office of Legal Consult the office bearer.
* To see how we can improve the current technical implementations of the Hub (including the Website, Group etc).
* To appoint members to the Department of IT on a preliminary basis.
* To elect the new head(s), i.e the CICs, of Project Troopers

_Raised by the liaison from the Election Committee; Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A._

**Consensus formulated:-**

1. To not post the link to the Google Drive backend in the groups to avoid DMCA takedown requests, and to ensure that there is high volume of activity in the group. _(introduced as Deepan and Harshavardhan believed that there was less activity in the core group.)_
2. To emphasise that the IT Manager must find alternatives to the current Google Drive storage system in order to ensure continued access to materials. _(suggested by Sugeeth, the liaison from the TEC)_
3. To adopt the interpretation of Clause 10 of the “Office of the CIC” section in the DOPA 2024 Act as “if members of the Board wish to hold the post, no more than 33% of the Board’s members would be allowed to hold the post at the same time”.
4. To approve Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A., head of election committee, to concurrently take up the position of **“CIC of Project Troopers”** as under the DOPA 2024, TECRR 2024 and the Legal Stature of Project Troopers. \
   **Adopted Justification:** The CIC does not need to be a _director-per-sé_, he just gains the level of ownership, director, and a CA-A pass, where the word “**level**” refers to a post with similar powers. And the TECCR only does not allow the Election Committee head to be a “director”. So he is allowed to hold the top office of CIC.

_There were no objections to the above consensus from any director._\
_The Project Troopers' related legislation pages and documentation has been updated to abide to the directives of the Board._\
_Other internal discussions have been omitted, as they are not relevant._

A caretaker Board did exist, consisting of final members of the First Board Session, to decide on crucial matters as and when required._

<details>

<summary>End of Tenure of the First Board Session</summary>

_July 06, 2024_

The board has been declared as dissolved, except for the purposes of [#proposal-0010](board-history.md#proposal-0010 "mention") and urgent matters regarding immediate supervision; by the Election Committee in light of the next election to the Board.

When the board has dissolved, it means that the directors and CIC(s) also subsequently automatically turn into caretakers as it indicates their end of tenure. The caretaker directors do not have power to enact or propose any new legislation unless it is decided to be absolutely necessary and detrimental to the operations of the project. The caretaker directors can participate in elections, as they are no longer officially directors. The caretaker directors and CICs, however, will lose all of their powers at the moment when the new board swears into office.

<summary>Consensus #0009: TECRR legislation</summary>

_May 30, 2024_

**Objective**: To discuss about the TECRR legislation put forward by the Election Committee due to moral limitations. The TECCR was put up in the board forum for consensus review as the election committee was down to one member, and thus felt that it was unable to make proper unbiased decisions.

_Requested by the head of the election committee Sugeeth Jayaraj. The exact request has been posted below:_

_"Hello board, I'm initiating a new consensus for your consideration, as the Election Committee is down to one member and thus it would not be democratic if I approve my own bill. Hope you guys would be kind enough to review this bill."_

**Consensus formulated:** The consensus was that there were no objections brought against the bill.

**Consequence: The TECRR** was brought into effect by the Head of the Election Committee Sugeeth Jayaraj S.A.

_This is a proposal that aims to change the basic essence of the Legal stature. It will follow the voting procedures enshrined in the legal stature (Version 1)._

_Raised by Co-CIC Deepan Sai._

Laws shall be reframed and simplified involving no legal actions or requirements- law shall only guide the members of the group.

<summary>Resolution #0006: Changes to the Election Committee and Board responsibilities</summary>

_April 28, 2024_

A resolution was passed that includes the following points:

* To allow a member from the election committee to stay as a liaison between the board and election committee. This will invariably mean that they will have to be part of this group, but they won't be a director-per-se. They would somewhat close to an advisor, who can request or initiate proposal in the group, but can't vote on them. They will have the powers of a director, without voting powers.
* To extend the timeframe to conduct the election for the next replacement director and put the responsibility of conducting the election on the election committee instead of Sugeeth, the caretaker CIC (as his caretaker period will end today night at 11:59 PM)
* To give the election committee the power to appoint any member of Project Troopers to itself (and invariably make them as administrators).
* To allow the election committee head to have admin access to all the groups and works of Project Troopers.
* To give each director a responsibility to maintain over a particular section of the Project Trooper operations on decisions that does not need Board approval, pertaining to that particular section. (Eg: Class 12 operations, Hub educational operations, Legal operations etc)
* To define the option of 'recluse' as (I) automatic, when the involvement of a director in voting is controversial or is about a case which is about them or if they are an outgoing director (II) manual, as decided by the board
* To initiate an internal consensus (discussion) about the feasibility of giving the directors a particular tenure to serve in, and to put forth laws that would allow only 1/3rd of the board members' tenure to expire at any given point in time, with reasonable exceptions.

**Vote results: 3-1-0-1-1**\
&#xNAN;_&#x56;ote results are in the for-against-neutral-abstained-reclused format._\
&#xNAN;_**Timeframe**: By April 28, 2024 at 6:00 PM, as one of the points in this proposal need immediate attention... which was extended for one more day._

<summary>Consensus #0002: Proposal for Expanding Computer Corps Program Summary</summary>

A student, recommended by a friend of Aakash, has expressed interest in joining the exclusive Computer Corps. The current structure limits participation to students from our school.

#### Considerations

1. **Inclusivity vs. Exclusivity**: Balancing the program's exclusiveness with potential benefits of inclusivity.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assessing if expansion could strain resources or diminish the quality of the program.
3. **Precedent Setting**: Deciding whether this case sets a precedent for future admissions from outside the current internal setup.

#### Recommendations

1. **Expand Internally**: Allow the interested student to join the current Computer Corps, evaluating the impact on the group dynamics and resources.
2. **Create a New Group**: Alternatively, establish a separate computer group for external participants, maintaining the exclusiveness of the original Corps but fostering outreach and inclusivity.

#### Decision Requested

The Board of Directors was kindly asked to deliberate on the mentioned recommendations and make a decision regarding the most suitable approach for the inclusion of the student and potential future external candidates.

#### Discussion

* The Troopers Project is expanding to include others friends too. Accordingly, a restructuring has been initiated.
* Each section or class will constitute or be allegorised as a “Regiment”.
* ⁠If there are separate groups for a subject, it will be called or allegorised as a “Corps” (an army entity that is supposed to provide services).
* ⁠There will be a main “Front/Division” (a group of regiments) group where all members will be allowed to discuss.
* ⁠All groups which have only our friends of one group will be fitted with the moniker “First”.
* ⁠All groups which have only our friends in the second group will be fitted with the moniker “Second”.

The speaker is discontinuing (sunsetting) the current "Psychology" group of the Troopers Project because there is already another Psychology group consisting of all Psychology students in Class 11. The speaker wants to respect the independence of this alternate group. However, if the alternate Psychology group wants to join the Troopers project, they are welcome to do so.

Once again, an invitation is being extended to all individuals who possess materials or have an interest in contributing to the Troopers Hub. It is requested that volunteers actively maintain various sections such as "Psychology", "Computer Science", "Announcements", and "Homework", among others. Contributions ranging from graphic designing, physical drawings, materials, videos, and software-related skills (like API versioning, endpoints, etc) will be highly appreciated. A poll was posted to gauge interest and availability.

After a small problem involving an non-participating party, the description of the Troopers Group was changed to provide more clarity on the function of the group as a whole. The verdict of an admin has been attached above (may contain personal info).

This is the old description of the WhatsApp Doubt Group.
