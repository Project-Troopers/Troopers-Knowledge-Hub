# Arbitration Committee (ArbCom)

### What is the Arbitration Committee?

Empowered by the Legal stature, the ArbCom is an independent wing of Project Troopers that acts as a court of last resort, i.e it’s job is to hear cases, and decide upon them using the powers granted to it.

### Inspiration

We are modelled after the Indian Constitution’s powerful Judiciary and the English Wikipedia’s Arbitration Committee; which deal with cases and uphold the laws of their respective communities.

### Are we in force yet?

Nope, but we plan to come into force soon… as soon we create our own structure by the power vested in us.
