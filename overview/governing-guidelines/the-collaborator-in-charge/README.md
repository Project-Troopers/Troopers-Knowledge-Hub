### Deputy CIC

{% hint style="info" %}
**Position is being currently held by Deepan Sai**\
**Deputy CIC of Project Troopers (First Term)**\
_has voting rights and director-level powers._
{% endhint %}

The Deputy of the CIC shares the same burdens, restrictions and powers as that of the CIC, however there will be a few changes:-

1. The office of the Deputy CIC is also bound to the CIC's decisions, and the deputy's authority or powers in no way supersedes that of the CIC.
2. On the occasion that the CIC is unable to take administrative decisions when the CIC mentions to the Board that he may be unavailable with a solid and sound mind (requires proper proof and attestation by a JPR Body), the deputy will act as the CIC of Project Troopers temporarily until the CIC reassumes duties.
3. The Deputy's term will end at the same time that the CIC's official term ends. If the term of the CIC ends prematurely due to impeachment or resignation, the Deputy immediately assumes the office of the CIC, leaving the seat of the Deputy as vacant and shall complete the remainder of the term of the CIC, subject to Board approval. If the Board shall disapprove of him assuming the office of the CIC, then the office-bearer will be automatically dismissed from the office of the Deputy CIC.
4. The Deputy CIC will not automatically have access to all operations and bodies of Project Troopers. It will either be subject to the approval of the CIC or the approval of the Board. The approval of the CIC can be revoked by the Board. The CIC cannot revoke the approval of the Board unless the Board gives him powers to do so.

[^1]: The Second Session of the Board of Directors, after much deliberation, have decided to interpret this clause officially as `"if members of the Board wish to hold the post, no more than 33% of the Board’s members would be allowed to hold the post at the same time".`   \
