<summary><strong>Executive Directive of the CIC #0004: 1st Operational Shutdown</strong></summary>

&#x20;_January 23, 2024 - 06:42 PM IST_

**To all Directors, Committees, and Members of Project Troopers,**

In light of the upcoming **JEE Mains 2025 January Session** and the resulting unavailability of key personnel, this directive mandates a **temporary suspension of major operations** for all JPR bodies and their associated authorities from **January 24, 2025, 12:01 AM IST, until January 29, 2025, 9:00 PM IST**. During this period, these bodies will function in a **limited capacity**, attending only to **operational emergencies**, while all non-critical administrative tasks, discussions, and decision-making processes will be deferred.

#### **Affected Entities:**

The following administrative and legislative structures will be impacted:

* The Board of Directors
* The Department of IT
* The Arbitration Committee (ArbCom)
* The Election Committee
* The Office of Legal Consult
* The Office of the Collaborator In-Charge (including the Assistant Collaborator In-Charge)
* The Extraordinary General Meeting Council
* All other affiliated bodies and authorities under JPR jurisdiction

#### **Rationale for the Shutdown:**

Given that many of the members serving in key administrative roles are also participants in the JEE Mains 2025 January Session, a consensus decision was reached among the **Board of Directors** to implement this **temporary operational pause**. The primary objective is to ensure that members are **not burdened by administrative responsibilities during this crucial academic period**, allowing them to focus on their examinations without disruption.

#### **Operational Guidelines:**

* **Emergency-only functioning:** The affected entities will operate **solely for handling urgent operational matters**. Non-urgent communications and requests **will not be entertained** during this period.
* **Authority of Individual Directors:** Elected directors may continue exercising their **individual authority**, as their mandate originates directly from the membership through elections.
* **Uninterrupted Core Functions:** The **WhatsApp Community and Project Troopers Website** will remain fully operational and accessible to all members.

#### **Implementation and Compliance:**

This directive is to be strictly adhered to by all affected bodies and personnel. Failure to comply may result in administrative review post-resumption.

#### **Associated Service Notification**

From **January 24, 2025, 12:01 AM IST, to January 29, 2025, 9:00 PM IST**, all administrative and legislative bodies of Project Troopers will operate at a **reduced capacity**, restricted to handling **operational emergencies only** due to the **JEE Mains 2025 January Session**. Routine queries may experience **delays in response** during this period.

The **WhatsApp Community and Website** will continue to function normally.

<summary>Executive Directive #0002: Reiteration of Vision of Project Troopers</summary>

_October 10, 2024 - 06:31 PM IST_

As the CIC, it is my duty to inform everyone to transform the archived materials on the Jugzards backend into more useful educational information. Though we will, and should, maintain all the materials on the archive for future citation reference, we must use those materials as inspiration to create/transform our educational pages (as a non-profit) into better versions of themselves.

E.g. Our English Materials for Class 11 is really good as it contains original work and inspiration from other sources, it's really good

_This is an reiteration of our vision._
