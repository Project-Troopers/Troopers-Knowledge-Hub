<summary>Executive Directive #0002: Reiteration of Vision of Project Troopers</summary>

_October 10, 2024 - 06:31 PM IST_

As the CIC, it is my duty to inform everyone to transform the archived materials on the Jugzards backend into more useful educational information. Though we will, and should, maintain all the materials on the archive for future citation reference, we must use those materials as inspiration to create/transform our educational pages (as a non-profit) into better versions of themselves.

E.g. Our English Materials for Class 11 is really good as it contains original work and inspiration from other sources, it's really good

_This is an reiteration of our vision._
